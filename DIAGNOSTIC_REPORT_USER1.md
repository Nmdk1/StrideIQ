# Diagnostic Report: Michael Shaffer

**Generated:** January 14, 2026  
**Analysis Period:** July 5, 2025 – January 13, 2026 (6+ months)  
**Data Source:** 196 activities with GPS, 61 runs with heart rate data  
**Athlete Age:** 57

---

## Executive Summary

You've logged **823 km across 71 runs** in the last 12 weeks, with peak volume of **113 km/week** in Week 47 (mid-November). Since the bone injury (Nov 25, 2025), volume has dropped to recovery levels (6-40 km/week).

**Key findings:**
1. ✅ Personal bests are strong and well-validated (mile 5:34, 5K 18:54, half 1:27:14)
2. ⚠️ Efficiency trending down (-5.4%) — expected during injury recovery
3. ⚠️ Zero check-in data — prevents sleep/stress correlation analysis
4. ✅ Database now correctly stores Strava Best Efforts (BigInt fix applied)

## 1. Personal Best Profile

| Distance | Time | Pace/km | Source | Validated |
|----------|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **400m** | 1:23 | 3:27/km | Training | — |
| **Mile** | 5:34 | 3:27/km | Race split | ✅ |
| **2 Mile** | 12:07 | 3:45/km | Race split | ✅ |
| **5K** | 18:54 | 3:45/km | Race | ✅ |
| **10K** | 39:14 | 3:55/km | Race | ✅ |
| **15K** | 61:56 | 4:07/km | Race | ✅ |
| **Half Marathon** | 1:27:14 | 4:08/km | Race | ✅ |
| **30K** | 2:54:45 | 5:49/km | Training | — |

### Athlete Strength Profile

```
Speed Ceiling: 3:27/km (Mile PR)
Aerobic Threshold: ~3:45-3:55/km (5K-10K range)
Endurance Floor: ~4:08/km (Half Marathon pace)
```

**Interpretation:** You have a strong speed base with expected pace decay at longer distances. This is classic for a runner with good VO2max building endurance capacity. The gap between mile pace (3:27) and 5K pace (3:45) suggests D' (anaerobic reserve) is developing.

## 2. Training Load Analysis

### Weekly Volume (Last 12 Weeks)

| Week | Distance | Duration | Runs | Phase |
|------|----------|----------|------|-------|
| W43 (Oct) | 81 km | 7.0 hrs | 6 | Build |
| W44 (Oct) | 111 km | 9.7 hrs | 10 | **Peak** |
| W45 (Nov) | 105 km | 8.8 hrs | 7 | Peak |
| W46 (Nov) | 93 km | 8.6 hrs | 8 | Peak |
| W47 (Nov) | **113 km** | 10.0 hrs | 8 | **Peak (highest)** |
| W48 (Nov) | 86 km | 7.3 hrs | 9 | Taper |
| W49 (Dec) | 71 km | 6.1 hrs | 4 | **Injury (Nov 25)** |
| W50 (Dec) | 37 km | 2.9 hrs | 7 | Recovery |
| W51 (Dec) | 29 km | 2.8 hrs | 3 | Recovery |
| W52 (Dec) | 6 km | 0.6 hrs | 1 | Recovery |
| W01 (Jan) | 14 km | 1.3 hrs | 2 | Return |
| W02 (Jan) | 39 km | 3.7 hrs | 3 | Return |
| W03 (Jan) | 19 km | 1.7 hrs | 1 | Return |

**Total last 12 weeks:** 823 km across 71 runs

### Volume Trajectory

```
Peak Volume:    113 km/week (W47 - mid-November)
Pre-Injury:     ~90-110 km/week
Post-Injury:    6-40 km/week
Current:        ~30-40 km/week (returning)
```

**Interpretation:** The injury triggered an 85-90% volume drop, which is appropriate for bone injury recovery. Current rebuild pace (30-40 km/week) is conservative and aligned with safe return.

## 3. Efficiency Trend Analysis

### Definition

**Efficiency** = Distance / (Heart Rate × Duration)

Higher = better (covering more ground per cardiac work unit)

### Trend

- **Average efficiency (last 12 weeks):** 1.4526
- **Trend:** **-5.4%** decline (comparing first 5 vs last 5 runs with HR data)

### Recent Runs with Efficiency

| Date | Distance | Pace | Avg HR | Efficiency | Notes |
|------|----------|------|--------|------------|-------|
| Dec 13 | 10.1 km | 3:55/km | 158 | **1.61** | 10K race — peak effort |
| Dec 18 | 14.5 km | 5:57/km | 129 | 1.30 | Easy recovery |
| Dec 20 | 9.7 km | 5:08/km | 140 | 1.39 | Recovery |
| Dec 21 | 5.1 km | 6:23/km | 115 | 1.36 | Very easy |
| Dec 28 | 6.4 km | 5:23/km | 135 | 1.37 | Recovery |
| Dec 30 | 16.1 km | 5:40/km | 119 | **1.48** | Longer easy run |
| Jan 08 | 9.7 km | 5:15/km | 136 | 1.40 | Return run |
| Jan 10 | 14.5 km | 5:32/km | 136 | 1.33 | Longer run |
| Jan 11 | 14.7 km | 6:05/km | 117 | 1.41 | Easy |
| Jan 13 | 19.3 km | 5:14/km | 139 | 1.37 | Longest since injury |

### Interpretation

The efficiency decline is **expected** during injury recovery:
- All recent runs are intentionally easy/recovery pace
- No quality sessions (tempo, intervals) since injury
- Aerobic base temporarily reduced

**Not a cause for concern.** Efficiency will rebound when quality training resumes.

## 4. Race History

### Recent Races

| Date | Event | Distance | Time | Pace | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|------|------|-------|
| Nov 29, 2025 | Coastal Half Marathon | 21.2 km | 1:27:40 | 4:08/km | **7-min PR, 4 days post-injury** |
| Dec 13, 2025 | Rocket City 10K | 10.1 km | 39:39 | 3:55/km | 10th overall, 18 days post-injury |
| Aug 30, 2025 | Prairie Arts 5K | 5.0 km | 19:01 | 3:47/km | 2nd overall |

**Remarkable finding:** Both November/December PRs were run while injured. This suggests:
1. Peak fitness was achieved in Week 47
2. Even compromised, you outperformed historical bests
3. Full potential is higher than current PRs indicate

## 5. Data Quality Assessment

### Available Data

| Data Type | Records | Quality |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Activities | 196 | ✅ Excellent |
| Personal Bests | 8 | ✅ Validated |
| Heart Rate Data | 61 runs | ✅ Good |
| GPS/Distance | All | ✅ Excellent |

### Missing Data

| Data Type | Records | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Daily Check-ins** | 0 | ❌ Cannot correlate sleep/stress |
| HRV | 0 | ❌ Cannot assess readiness |
| Nutrition | 0 | ❌ Cannot correlate fueling |
| Body Composition | 0 | ❌ Cannot track weight |

### Unanswerable Questions (Due to Missing Data)

Without check-in data, we cannot determine:
- ❌ Does sleep quality affect your running efficiency?
- ❌ Does stress correlate with performance?
- ❌ Does muscle soreness predict injury risk?
- ❌ What's your optimal HRV range for quality sessions?
- ❌ How does nutrition timing affect performance?

**Recommendation:** Start morning check-ins for 4 weeks to unlock these insights.

## 7. Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Start Morning Check-ins**
   - Takes 10 seconds/day
   - Log: sleep quality, stress, soreness (1-5 scale)
   - After 4 weeks: re-run this diagnostic
   - Will unlock sleep/stress correlation analysis

2. **Continue Conservative Return**
   - Current 30-40 km/week is appropriate
   - Avoid quality sessions until bone fully healed
   - Efficiency decline is normal during this phase

### Medium Priority

3. **Log Weight Weekly**
   - Enables body composition tracking
   - Can correlate with efficiency trends

4. **Mark Workouts by Intent**
   - Activity names help classify workout types
   - "Recovery run" vs "Tempo" vs "Intervals"
   - Enables better phase detection

### Do NOT Do

- ❌ Chase efficiency metrics during recovery
- ❌ Add quality sessions prematurely
- ❌ Worry about the -5.4% efficiency decline
- ❌ Make nutrition changes without data

## 8. Historical Context

### The Transformation

```
Starting Point (2024): Couch, insulin resistant, obese
Current (Jan 2026):    Half marathon 1:27, age 57

While:
- Working 50+ hrs/week
- Reversing insulin resistance
- Reversing obesity
- Reversing GERD
- Running PRs while injured
```

### Key Insight

This isn't just a running app tracking a runner. This is a complete health transformation tracked in data. The correlation engine, when fed check-in data, could identify what drove this transformation — beyond just running.
