# Read First (Investor)

## 1) One-page “what is it”
- `docs/EXECUTIVE_REPORT.md` (positioning, differentiation, current state)

## 2) Why this is defensible
- **N=1 mandate**: athlete evidence governs prescriptions (not population averages)
- **Trust contract**: receipts make outputs verifiable (reduces “AI hallucination” risk)
- **Viral-safe operations**: ingestion degrades gracefully under spikes (pause + deferral)

Read:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md`

## 3) Roadmap and execution proof
- `docs/PHASED_WORK_PLAN.md` (phases, definition of done, progress ledger)

## 4) Operational readiness (investor diligence)
- `docs/OPS_PLAYBOOK.md` (how the owner responds to incidents)
- `docs/adr/ADR-054-viral-safe-ingestion-resilience-and-emergency-brake.md`
