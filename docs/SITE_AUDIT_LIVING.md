# StrideIQ — Living Site Audit

**Purpose:** Canonical full-product audit. This is the always-current inventory of what exists on the site, what is shipped, and what operational tools are available.
**Last updated:** February 28, 2026
**Last updated by:** Advisor session — audit catch-up + production email hardening pass

---

## 0. Delta Since Last Audit (Feb 25 -> Feb 28)

Shipped and now live in product/system behavior:

- **Monetization v1 completed**: 4-tier pricing UX, checkout flows, settings tier display, plan pace lock/unlock UX, register intent carry-through.
- **PDF plan export shipped**: entitlement-gated endpoint `GET /v1/plans/{plan_id}/pdf`, WeasyPrint/Jinja backend generation, guarded limits.
- **Garmin brand/compliance surfaces updated**: official badge/icon usage on settings + activity/home surfaces; attribution wording tightened.
- **Home briefing reliability hardening shipped**: force-refresh triggers on Garmin/Strava sync paths plus deterministic fallback when LLM path is unavailable.
- **Run context science moat upgrade shipped**: `GarminDay` now gap-fills run context inputs when check-ins are missing; explicit source labeling and device stress qualifier path added.
- **Garmin ingestion health monitor shipped**: admin endpoint `GET /v1/admin/ops/ingestion/garmin-health` + daily Celery task + underfed coverage logging.
- **Email transport hardening shipped**: SMTP timeout control, explicit TLS context, and reset-link base URL now sourced from `WEB_APP_BASE_URL`.

### Production Layout

```
/opt/strideiq/repo/          ← Git checkout
docker compose up -d         ← 6 containers: api, web, caddy, postgres, redis, worker
API runs migrations on boot  ← alembic upgrade head in entrypoint
```

### Deployment Workflow

```
local: git push origin main
droplet: cd /opt/strideiq/repo && git pull origin main && docker compose up -d --build
```

Migration runs automatically on API container startup. Manual migration: `docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head`.

## 4. Intelligence Pipeline

### Daily Intelligence Engine (`services/daily_intelligence.py`)

Runs via `tasks/intelligence_tasks.py` every 15 minutes. For each qualifying athlete:
readiness → intelligence rules → narrate → persist.

**8 Rules:**

| # | Rule ID | Mode | Trigger |
|---|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | `LOAD_SPIKE` | INFORM | Volume/intensity up >15% week-over-week |
| 2 | `SELF_REG_DELTA` | LOG | Planned workout ≠ actual workout |
| 3 | `EFFICIENCY_BREAK` | INFORM | Efficiency improved >3% over 2 weeks |
| 4 | `PACE_IMPROVEMENT` | INFORM | Faster pace + lower HR vs target |
| 5 | `SUSTAINED_DECLINE` | FLAG | 3+ weeks declining efficiency |
| 6 | `SUSTAINED_MISSED` | ASK | >25% skip rate over 2 weeks |
| 7 | `READINESS_HIGH` | SUGGEST | High readiness + easy-only for 10+ days |
| 8 | `CORRELATION_CONFIRMED` | INFORM | Reproducible check-in → performance pattern (3+ confirmations) |

### Correlation Engine (`services/correlation_engine.py`)

Discovers N=1 correlations between inputs (check-in data, training load, body composition) and outputs (efficiency, pace, completion rate).

- **Statistical gates:** p < 0.05, |r| >= 0.3, n >= 10
- **Time-shifted:** 0–7 day lags (catches "bad sleep → performance drops 2 days later")
- **Output metrics:** efficiency, pace_easy, pace_threshold, completion, efficiency by zone, PB events, race pace
- **Bonferroni correction** applied in N1 insight generator

### Correlation Persistence (`services/correlation_persistence.py`) — NEW

Findings are now stored permanently in `correlation_finding` table:

1. **Upsert on confirm:** Same (athlete, input, output, lag) → `times_confirmed += 1`
2. **Deactivate on fade:** Previously-significant finding drops below threshold → `is_active = False`
3. **Surfacing gate:** Only findings with `times_confirmed >= 3` are eligible
4. **Cooldown:** Once surfaced, 14-day cooldown before re-surfacing
5. **Confidence boost:** `confidence * (1 + 0.1 * (times_confirmed - 1))`, capped at 1.0
6. **Daily limit:** Max 2 correlation insights per day per athlete

### N1 Insight Generator (`services/n1_insight_generator.py`)

Generates polarity-aware insights from correlation engine output. Categorizes as `what_works`, `what_doesnt`, or `pattern` (ambiguous metrics). Uses `OutputMetricMeta` registry for polarity.

### Adaptation Narrator (`services/adaptation_narrator.py`)

Phase 3A. Gemini Flash generates 2–3 sentence coaching narrations for each InsightLog entry.
- Scored against engine ground truth (3 binary criteria: factually correct, no raw metrics, actionable language)
- Score < 0.67 → suppressed (silence > bad narrative)
- Contradiction detected → suppressed
- Results stored in `NarrationLog`

### Readiness Score (`services/readiness_score.py`)

Phase 2A. Composite score from efficiency trend, recovery balance, completion rate, recovery days.
- Sleep currently **excluded** from readiness until correlation engine proves individual relationship (per rebuild plan)

---

## 5. Check-in Data Flow (End-to-End)

This is the full lifecycle of check-in data:

```
Athlete → Home Page Quick Check-in (or /checkin page)
    ↓
POST /v1/daily-checkin → DailyCheckin table
    ↓ (optimistic UI update — UI switches instantly, background refetch)
    ↓
Correlation Engine (called on-demand or via daily intelligence)
    ↓ aggregates: sleep_h, soreness_1_5, motivation_1_5, stress_1_5, etc.
    ↓ correlates with: activity efficiency, pace, completion
    ↓ time-shifted: 0–7 day lags
    ↓
persist_correlation_findings() → correlation_finding table
    ↓ upsert: increment times_confirmed or create new
    ↓ deactivate faded patterns
    ↓
Daily Intelligence Engine (Rule 8: CORRELATION_CONFIRMED)
    ↓ checks: times_confirmed >= 3, is_active, not recently surfaced
    ↓
InsightLog → Adaptation Narrator → Narrated to athlete
    ↓
"Based on your data: your running efficiency noticeably tends to
 improve within 2 days when your sleep hours are higher. This
 pattern has been confirmed 4 times — it's becoming a reliable signal."
```

**Also consumed by:**
- `run_analysis_engine.py` — same-day + trailing checkin context for individual run analysis
- `causal_attribution.py` — Granger causality testing (0–7 day impacts)
- `trend_attribution.py` — identifies factors preceding efficiency trends (0–2 day lags)
- `pattern_recognition.py` — trailing context for PR pattern analysis
- `pre_race_fingerprinting.py` — race-day wellness vs baseline
- `ai_coach.py` — recent checkin data in coaching context
- `coach_tools.py` — `get_wellness_trends()` aggregation

---

## 6. Frontend Architecture

### Key Pages

| Route | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `/home` | Morning command center: coach briefing, workout, check-in, race countdown | Working — optimistic check-in fix shipped 2/16 |
| `/activities` | Activity list with mini charts | Working |
| `/activities/[id]` | Activity detail: Run Shape Canvas, splits, analysis | Working — needs narrative moments |
| `/calendar` | Training calendar with plan overlay | Working |
| `/coach` | AI coach chat interface | Strongest surface in the product |
| `/progress` | Race readiness, predictions, pace zones, PBs | Working |
| `/analytics` | Efficiency trends, correlations, load→response | Working |
| `/training-load` | PMC chart, N=1 zones, daily stress | Working |

## 7. Build Priority & Phase Status

From `docs/TRAINING_PLAN_REBUILD_PLAN.md`:

| Phase | Status | Tests |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Plans) | COMPLETE | 158 passing |
| Phase 2 (Adaptation) | COMPLETE | 29 passing |
| Phase 3A (Narration) | COMPLETE | 66 passing |
| Coach Trust | COMPLETE | 22 passing |
| Phase 3B (Workout Narratives) | CODE COMPLETE — gate accruing | 65+ passing, 24 xfail |
| Phase 3C (N=1 Insights) | CODE COMPLETE — gate accruing | 65+ passing, 26 xfail |
| Phase 4 (50K Ultra) | CONTRACT ONLY | 37 xfail |
| Monetization Tiers | v1 COMPLETE (core revenue surfaces shipped) | residual xfails remain for deferred advisory/intelligence tier contracts |

**Build priority order (current):**
1. Phase 4 (50K Ultra)
2. Phase 3B (when narration quality gate clears — >90% for 4 weeks)
3. Phase 3C (when per-athlete synced history + significant correlations exist)
4. Monetization deferred contracts (promote remaining xfails only as underlying features land)

**Open gates:**
- 3B: narration accuracy > 90% for 4 weeks (`/v1/intelligence/narration/quality`)
- 3C: per-athlete synced history + significant correlations (founder rule: immediate if history exists)

**119 xfail contract tests** become real tests when gates clear.

## 8. Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Active Issues
- **Garmin production-access process still pending final completion** — evaluation environment is active; endpoint compliance and submission package are in progress with Partner Services.
- **Garmin physiology coverage is underfed for connected athletes** — monitor now exists (`/v1/admin/ops/ingestion/garmin-health`) and currently indicates sparse sleep/HRV population for some athletes.
- ~~**Email deliverability wiring remains operationally sensitive**~~ — **RESOLVED (Feb 28, 2026).** Production email is live: `smtp.gmail.com:587`, sender `noreply@strideiq.run` via `michael@strideiq.run`. Password reset E2E verified by Codex. DNS hardening (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) still needed at Porkbun.
- **Insights feed noise:** `/insights` Active Insights section has duplicate volume alerts and low-quality achievement cards — needs deduplication and quality filter
- **Activity detail moments:** some key moments still show raw metrics that need stronger narrative translation
- **Home page dual voice:** `compute_coach_noticed` and `morning_voice` still overlap; unify into one coherent briefing voice

### Technical Debt (Tracked, Not Blocking)
- 8 services with local efficiency polarity assumptions — migrate to `OutputMetricMeta` registry
- Timezone-aware vs naive datetime comparisons in `ensure_fresh_token` (observed during Danny's Strava debug)
- Sleep weight = 0.00 in readiness score — excluded until correlation engine proves individual relationship

### Resolved Issues
- **Chart date labels shifted by one day in US timezones (Mar 1, 2026)** — All Recharts date axes now use UTC methods (`getUTCMonth()`, `getUTCDate()`, `timeZone: 'UTC'`) to prevent local-timezone date shift. Fixed in `training-load/page.tsx` (PMC + Daily TSS charts, 4 locations) and `LoadResponseChart.tsx`, `AgeGradedChart.tsx`, `EfficiencyChart.tsx` (3 locations). 7 locations total.
- **Monetization v1 closure (Feb 26, 2026)** — 4-tier purchase and entitlement surfaces now shipped end-to-end (pricing/settings/checkout/locked-pace UX/register carry-through).
- **PDF plan export shipped (Feb 26, 2026)** — entitlement-gated download endpoint and full backend generation path live.
- **Garmin sync-to-briefing staleness hardening (Feb 27-28, 2026)** — Garmin/Strava sync paths now explicitly mark briefing dirty and enqueue refresh; deterministic fallback prevents stale lock-in when LLM path fails.
- **Run context GarminDay gap-fill (Feb 28, 2026)** — run analysis now consumes Garmin physiology when check-ins are missing, without overwriting athlete self-report.
- **Garmin ingestion health monitor (Feb 28, 2026)** — new admin endpoint and daily worker checks make underfed physiology visible.
- **Password-reset email transport hardening (Feb 28, 2026)** — SMTP send path now uses timeout + TLS context; reset links now derive from `WEB_APP_BASE_URL`; logging clarified for send failure scenarios.
- **Sleep prompt grounding (Feb 24, 2026)** — Home morning briefing cited wrong sleep hours (7.5h vs 6h45 Garmin / 7.0h manual). Fixed with: `_build_checkin_data_dict()` (sleep_h numeric now in prompt), `_get_garmin_sleep_h_for_last_night()` (device sleep as ground truth), SLEEP SOURCE CONTRACT in prompt, `validate_sleep_claims()` validator (0.5h tolerance), wellness trends recency prefix. 22 new regression tests. Commit `494b9e9`.
- **Garmin disconnect 500 (Feb 24, 2026)** — `POST /v1/garmin/disconnect` crashed with `ForeignKeyViolation` on `activity_split`. Fixed by deleting `ActivitySplit` rows before `Activity` rows in the disconnect handler. Commit `9b11504`.
- **SEV-1: Coach stream hanging on "Thinking..." (Feb 17, 2026)** — fixed with 120s hard timeout + try/except + SSE error event in `ai_coach.py`
- **SEV-1: Home page LLM blocking all requests (Feb 17, 2026)** — fixed by splitting `generate_coach_home_briefing` into two phases: DB on request thread, LLM on worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread` + 15s `asyncio.wait_for`
- **SEV-1: `--workers 3` OOM (Feb 17, 2026)** — reverted; 1 vCPU / 2GB droplet cannot run multiple uvicorn workers

### Demo Account Safety
- `is_demo` flag on Athlete model (migration: `demo_guard_001`)
- Strava `/auth-url` and `/callback` endpoints return 403 for demo accounts
- Demo accounts use synthetic data only

---

## 9. Key Operational Procedures

### Strava Sync Troubleshooting
1. Check `AthleteIngestionState` for the athlete
2. Verify token validity: `ensure_fresh_token` may have timezone issues
3. Check Strava scopes — must include `activity:read_all`
4. If scope missing: athlete must revoke on `strava.com/settings/apps`, then reconnect ensuring checkbox is selected
5. Direct OAuth URL can be generated server-side for low-friction reconnect

### Cache Invalidation
- Stream analysis: bump `CURRENT_ANALYSIS_VERSION` in the analysis service
- Correlation cache: Redis 24h TTL, auto-expires
- Home page: `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['home'] })` from frontend

### Emergency Brake
- `system.ingestion_paused` DB flag prevents new ingestion work during incidents
- Workers on 429 mark as deferred (not error) with `deferred_until`

### Email Delivery Activation (Production)
1. Update `/opt/strideiq/repo/.env` (compose env file in current production setup) with:
   - `EMAIL_ENABLED=true`
   - `SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com`
   - `SMTP_PORT=587`
   - `SMTP_USERNAME=<workspace sender>`
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD=<google app password>`
   - `FROM_EMAIL=<workspace sender>`
   - `FROM_NAME=StrideIQ`
2. Recreate API service (restart alone does not reload env vars):
   - `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --force-recreate api`
3. Runtime verify inside container:
   - print effective email settings (excluding password)
4. Run forgot-password E2E and verify sender branding/domain in inbox.

### Infrastructure Constraints (HARD RULES)
- **Server: Hostinger KVM 8 — 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 400GB NVMe.** Migrated from DigitalOcean (1 vCPU, 2GB) on Feb 25, 2026. Old droplet `104.248.212.71` kept as 24-48h safety net.
- **Uvicorn workers:** Currently 1. Safe to increase to 3-4 with 32GB RAM (each worker uses ~600MB). Increase requires founder sign-off.
- **Deploys are faster on 8 vCPU** but still cause brief downtime during `docker compose up -d --build`. Do not deploy during demo calls.
- **LLM calls MUST have hard timeouts.** Every external LLM call (Anthropic, Gemini) must have both an SDK-level timeout AND a callsite-level `asyncio.wait_for` timeout. Best practice regardless of worker count.
- **Never pass a request-scoped SQLAlchemy `db` session to `asyncio.to_thread`.** Sessions are not thread-safe. Do DB work on the request thread, pass pure data to the worker thread.
- **Home page (`/v1/home`) must never block on LLM.** If LLM times out, return `coach_briefing=None` and let deterministic data render. The page must load in <5s worst case.

## 10. Billing / Monetization Integration (Live)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | 4-tier: Free / One-time $5 / Guided $15/mo ($150/yr) / Premium $25/mo ($250/yr) |
| Webhook endpoint | `https://strideiq.run/v1/billing/webhooks/stripe` |
| Core webhook events | `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted` |
| Entitlement enforcement | Canonical tier utilities + pace-access checks |
| Revenue artifact | PDF plan export gated by paid entitlement |

**Key files:**
- `apps/api/core/tier_utils.py` — canonical tier normalization/satisfaction
- `apps/api/services/stripe_service.py` — checkout, portal, webhook processing, idempotency
- `apps/api/routers/billing.py` — billing endpoints
- `apps/api/core/pace_access.py` — one-time unlock + tier entitlement checks
- `apps/api/routers/plan_export.py` and `apps/api/services/plan_pdf.py` — paid PDF export path

**Subscription flow:** Stripe webhook updates subscription mirror and athlete tier state used by gating utilities.

**ADR:** `docs/adr/ADR-055-stripe-mvp-hosted-checkout-portal-and-webhooks.md`

## 12. Alembic Migration Chain

Current head: `corr_persist_001` (chains off `demo_guard_001` ← `sleep_quality_001` ← `rsi_cache_001` ← ...)

CI enforces single-head integrity via `.github/scripts/ci_alembic_heads_check.py`.
Max 2 roots allowed (main chain + phase chain).

When adding a new migration: **must chain off the current head** — update `down_revision` and `EXPECTED_HEADS` in the CI script.

---

## 13. Session Handoff Protocol

**Every session must:**
1. Read this document first to understand current state
2. Read `docs/TRAINING_PLAN_REBUILD_PLAN.md` for build priorities and gates
3. Read `docs/FOUNDER_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md` for working style expectations
4. Update this document before closing with:
   - Any new models/tables added
   - Any new services created
   - Any infrastructure changes
   - Updated counts if significant
   - New known issues discovered
   - Issues resolved

**Session handoff files** are in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_YYYY-MM-DD.md` — these capture session-specific details. This living audit captures cumulative system state.

---

## 14. Audit Contract (Always-Current Requirement)

This document is not a session recap. It is the founder-facing master audit.

Non-negotiable operating rules:

1. Every material ship updates this file in the same session.
2. Changes must reflect product truth (shipped behavior), not plans.
3. New route/surface/tool means inventory update here before closeout.
4. "Built but hidden/flagged" must still be listed with flag/gate status.
5. If something is uncertain, mark it as unknown explicitly (never assume).

---

---

## 16. Update Checklist (must run at session close)

Before any agent marks work complete:

1. Update shipped behavior in this audit (not just handoff doc).
2. Update inventory lists if routes/tools/modules changed.
3. Move/annotate items between Active Issues and Resolved Issues.
4. Update build priority order if phase status changed.
5. Ensure this file can stand alone for founder review without reading handoffs.
