# StrideIQ — Product Manifesto

*Written by the founder. This is the soul of the product. Every agent, every
session, every feature decision is measured against what's written here.*

StrideIQ is the first product that gives an athlete's body a voice.

Every runner generates thousands of data points — heart rate, pace, cadence,
elevation, effort — and alongside those, they live a life: they sleep well or
poorly, they're stressed or calm, they're sore or fresh, they eat well or skip
meals, they push through or pull back. Today, all of that data sits in silos.
Strava shows you a line chart. Garmin shows you five disconnected panels. Runna
gives you a workout. None of them connect your Tuesday sleep to your Thursday
tempo. None of them notice that your best races happen when you back off volume
two days before, not three. None of them see that your body's strongest
adaptation pattern is the 48-hour rebound after threshold work, and that last
night's 6 hours of sleep is about to blunt it.

StrideIQ sees all of it. Not because it has better charts — because it has 150+
intelligence tools that have been studying YOU. Your correlations. Your causal
patterns. Your time-lagged responses. Your self-regulation habits. Your
readiness signals. Your efficiency trajectory. Your recovery fingerprint.
Individually, each of those is a feature on a page somewhere. Together, they are
a portrait of your body that no human coach could hold in their head across two
years of training.

The vision is not to show that portrait as pages of analytics. The vision is to
give it a voice.

When you open the app in the morning, your data speaks to you. Not a
compliment. Not a card stack. Your body's analyst tells you what it sees — the
one thing that matters today, grounded in your numbers, contextualized by your
plan, informed by your history. It draws from every system simultaneously
because it knows you as one person, not as twelve separate dashboards.

When you finish a run, the effort flows through the pace line in color — cool
blues where you were easy, warm amber where you pushed, deep crimson at your
limit. You see the shape of your effort, and scattered along that shape are
moments where the system noticed something you couldn't feel: a cadence shift
in rep 5 that means your body found a more efficient gear, a recovery delay
after rep 8 that means you were at your session limit. Not labels. Not "Grade
Adjusted Anomaly: 4.7." A voice that says "your pace dropped here but the 4.7%
grade explains it — your effort was steady through this climb."

When you look at your week, you don't see seven dots. You see your training as
a narrative — what you did, why it mattered, how your body responded, what's
coming next. The plan isn't "4mi easy." It's "absorption day — your body's
pattern shows this is when the adaptation from yesterday's threshold locks in."

The surface is running. That's where the users are, that's where the data comes
from, that's what people will pay for. But underneath, the system understands
you as a whole person — because your sleep affects your tempo run, your stress
affects your recovery, your nutrition affects your long run, and no running app
has ever connected those dots for the individual. Health intelligence isn't a
feature. It's the reason the running intelligence is trustworthy.

The coach isn't a chat interface you visit when you have a question. The coach
is the voice of the system — present on every surface, speaking when it has
something worth saying, silent when it doesn't. It has 24 tools that can query
every intelligence system. When you want to go deeper, you talk to it. But the
daily intelligence finds you. You don't go looking for it.

This is what makes Strava, Garmin, Runna, Athletica, and Runalyze obsolete. Not
because StrideIQ has better charts or more features. Because StrideIQ is the
first product that knows you — personally, statistically, longitudinally — and
gives that knowledge a voice. The chart makes you open the app. The intelligence
makes you trust it. The voice makes you need it.

The engine for all of this is built. 111 services. 150+ tools. 55 architectural
decisions. 1,878 tests. The data is alive in the backend. It just doesn't speak
yet.

*This manifesto is the test for every feature, every screen, every line of
coach output: does it give the athlete's data a voice? If not, it doesn't
ship.*
