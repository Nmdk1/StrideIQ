## Proven Training Formula

### What Works for Michael

Based on analysis of his November 29, 2025 Half Marathon PR (7-minute improvement):

| Component | Specifics |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Weekly Volume** | ~100 km/week (62 mi) |
| **Runs Per Week** | 8+ |
| **Long Runs** | 2+ per week (one easy, one with pace) |
| **Tempo Sessions** | 1 per week, 6-10km at race pace or faster |
| **Speed Work** | In BASE phase only (summer) — see Injury Pattern below |
| **Primary Adaptations From** | Long run variations, threshold work, volume |

### Key Workout Types That Produce Results

1. **Fast Finish Long Run** - Start easy, finish at race pace
2. **Workout Long Run** - Extended distance at sub-race pace (e.g., 29km @ 4.44/km)
3. **Tempo Runs** - 6-10km at threshold (4:00-4:10/km pace)
4. **Over/Unders in Long Run** - Alternating 15s faster/slower than MP per mile
5. **Hill Strides (Roche style)** - Power/bounding 20-30s within easy hilly loops
6. **Summer Intervals** - Every Saturday + long run Sunday → Shattered 5K PB

### Speed Work: Timing Is Everything (CRITICAL INSIGHT)

**Intervals are NOT inherently dangerous.** The injury risk comes from WHEN they're introduced.

| Phase | Volume | Cumulative Fatigue | Intervals | Result |
|-------|--------|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| Summer (pre-build) | Moderate | Low | Every Saturday + LR Sunday | 5K PB shattered ✅ |
| Mid-build (week 9+) | 65-70 mi/wk | HIGH | Introduced intervals | Bone injury ❌ |

**The Real Pattern:**
- Intervals in **base/pre-build** (fresh legs, low cumulative fatigue) = **safe, productive**
- Intervals in **mid-build** (high volume, MP work stacking, 65+ mpw) = **injury risk**
- Age (57) amplifies susceptibility to injury **under cumulative fatigue**, not from the activity itself
- It's not the activity — it's when it's introduced

**Periodization Implication:**
```
PRE-BUILD / BASE (Summer):
  ✅ Strides, hill sprints, short intervals
  ✅ Building volume, legs fresh
  ✅ This is where speed work belongs

BUILD PHASE:
  ✅ T-work (safer, less explosive)
  ✅ MP work in long runs
  ❌ NO intervals — cumulative fatigue too high
  ❌ Volume already at 65-70+ mi/wk

PEAK:
  ✅ Race-specific (MP)
  ✅ Short, sharp T sessions
  ❌ NO new neuromuscular stress
```

## Training Philosophy

### McMillan Speed vs Endurance Responders (Michael's Take)

McMillan classifies runners as speed-dominant or endurance-dominant. Michael's view:
- Doesn't fully agree with it as an identity ("you ARE a speed type")
- Does believe in it for periodization ("you RESPOND to each better at different times")

**Application:**
- Summer (base): Responded to speed work (intervals) → 5K PR
- Fall (build): Responded to endurance + threshold + MP → Half/10K PRs
- Periodization should match stimulus to phase, not to a fixed "type"

### Periodization Approach

**T-Focus Block Example Progression:**
- Week 1: 6 × 5 min @ T pace
- Week 2: 5 × 6 min @ T pace
- Week 3: 4 × 8 min @ T pace
- Week 4: 3 × 10 min @ T pace
- Week 5: 2 × 15 min @ T pace
- Week 6: 40 min continuous @ T pace

**Volume-Appropriate Prescription:**
- Low mileage runner: Start with 5 × 2 min @ T pace
- High mileage runner: Can handle 2 × 20 min or 40 min continuous
- A 25 mpw runner should NOT do a 20-mile long run

### Weekly Structure (Current Understanding)

**Option A: Intensity + Easy Long**
- Hard workouts during the week (tempo, threshold intervals)
- Very easy long run on weekend
- Recovery prioritized after intensity

**Option B: Easy Week + Workout Long**
- No intensity during the week
- Weekend long run is the workout (fast finish, MP blocks, etc.)
- Treated as real stressor with easy day before and recovery after

**Age-Related Adaptation:**
- Can do 2-3 hard days in a ROW before rest (unlike younger pattern)
- But cannot combine weekly intensity + hard long run
- Recovery is MORE important now

## Injury History

### Pattern (Refined Understanding - January 2026)

**Previous interpretation:** "100% of injuries from interval work"  
**Corrected interpretation:** "Injuries occur when intervals are introduced under high cumulative fatigue"

| Injury Event | Context | Root Cause |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Bone injury (Nov 25, 2025) | Mid-build, 65-70 mi/wk, already done 18mi @ MP twice | Intervals introduced when cumulative fatigue was HIGH |
| Summer intervals | Base phase, moderate volume, fresh legs | NO INJURY — produced 5K PB |

**Key Insight:** The activity (intervals) is not the problem. The TIMING is:
- Fresh legs + intervals = safe, productive
- Fatigued legs (mid-build, high volume) + intervals = injury risk
- Age (57) + full-time work + cumulative fatigue = amplified susceptibility

### Injury Management
- December 2025: All runs were diagnostic/recovery (should have stopped entirely)
- Returns to running after allowing tissue to heal
- Diagnostic runs used to test readiness (NOT to train)
- Ran both fall PRs (half marathon Nov 29, 10K Dec 13) while injured — testament to fitness built

## November 2025 PR Build Analysis

### The Build (Oct 4 - Nov 29)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | 8 weeks |
| Avg Volume | 99 km/week |
| Runs Per Week | 8.1 |
| Long Runs | 19 total (>2 per week) |
| Tempo Sessions | 4 total |
| Interval Sessions | 0 completed (was starting when injured) |

### Key Workouts

| Date | Workout | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 10/12 | 29.0km @ 4.66/km | First race-pace long run |
| 10/18 | 16.1km @ 4.41/km | Breakthrough - faster than race pace |
| 11/09 | 29.0km @ 4.44/km | Race simulation (fastest long run) |
| 11/18 | 24.1km @ 4.73/km | Confidence builder (11 days out) |
| 10/09 | 6.4km @ 4.03/km | Tempo session |
| 10/23 | 8.1km @ 4.05/km | Tempo session |
| 10/31 | 6.4km @ 4.04/km | Tempo session |
| 11/21 | 8.5km @ 4.10/km | Final tempo (8 days out) |

### The Race

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Date | November 29, 2025 |
| Distance | 21.21 km |
| Time | 1:27:40 |
| Pace | 4.13/km |
| HR | 151 avg, 158 max |
| Result | 7-minute PR |
| Note | Ran with bone injury (injured Nov 25) |

### Why It Worked

1. **Volume created aerobic base** - 100km/week sustained
2. **Long run variations built specific endurance** - Pace in long runs, not separate speed
3. **Threshold work taught race pace** - 4:03-4:10/km in controlled doses
4. **Limited intensity = no injury** - Until intervals started, no issues
5. **Race pace was well-practiced** - Long runs progressed into race pace territory

## Prescriptive Rules for Michael

### DO
- **Speed work in BASE phase** (summer, pre-build) when legs are fresh
- Prioritize long run variations in BUILD phase
- Use tempo/threshold as primary intensity during BUILD
- High volume when healthy (up to 100km/week)
- Over/unders in long runs for MP practice
- Hill strides for power development (low injury risk, any phase)
- Progress workouts within blocks (e.g., 6×5min → 40min continuous)
- Cut-back every 4th week

### DO NOT
- Introduce intervals mid-build when cumulative fatigue is high
- Combine weekly intensity + hard long run (pick one)
- Rush return from injury
- Increase volume and intensity simultaneously
- Apply age-based limitations without data support
- Assume what works for population averages works for him

### MONITOR
- Cumulative fatigue level (volume, MP work already done)
- Signs of overreach (declining efficiency across similar workouts)
- Recovery quality (is he bouncing back?)
- Context before adding neuromuscular stress (intervals)

---

## Personal Training Preferences

### Favorite Workouts

1. **T Pace Intervals** - 6 × 5 min with 2 min recovery (progressable)
2. **Over/Unders Long Run** - Warmup, then alternating ±15s/mi from MP
3. **Hill Strides (Roche)** - 20-30s power/bounding within hilly loop

### Training Context

- Master's athlete (57) — but defies age-based expectations
- 2 years of running (rapid progression, still improving)
- Works full-time (life stress factor)
- Previous fitness from other activities
- Can handle high volume when healthy (100km/week)
- Injury risk tied to TIMING, not activity type (see Injury History)
- Getting faster every build cycle
- Beats most runners 15+ years younger

## Age Philosophy (Critical for Plan Generation)

> **Age is a variable, not a limiter.**

Michael's data proves that prevailing wisdom on age-related decline is often incorrect:

| Conventional Wisdom | Michael's Reality |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Older = slower | Getting faster every build |
| Older = less intensity | Handles T-work and high volume fine |
| Older = more rest days | Can do 2-3 hard days in a row |
| Older = reduced expectations | 7-min half PR, 3-min 10K PB at age 57 |

**For plan generation:**
- Age informs initial assumptions IF no other data exists
- Once individual data exists, it overrides age-based predictions
- Track age-related correlations but never prescribe based on age alone
- What matters: cumulative fatigue, recovery patterns, injury history — not birth year
