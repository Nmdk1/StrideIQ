# Boston Marathon - Race-Specific Preparation

## Race Profile

- **Distance:** 26.2 miles (42.195 km)
- **Date:** Third Monday of April (Patriots' Day)
- **Location:** Hopkinton to Boston, Massachusetts
- **Elevation Profile:** Net downhill (-450 ft), but rolling with significant hills
- **Typical Weather:** 40-60°F (4-15°C), variable

## Course Challenges

### Newton Hills (Miles 16-21)
- **Heartbreak Hill** at mile 20.5 is NOT the steepest, but comes after 3 prior hills
- Total climb in Newton: ~300 ft over 4 miles
- The "grind" effect is cumulative fatigue, not single hill difficulty

### Net Downhill Concerns
- First 4 miles drop 400+ feet
- **Quad damage** from early downhills affects hill climbing ability later
- Many runners go out too fast due to downhill start

### Weather Variables
- Can range from 30°F to 80°F historically
- Headwind from east is common in later miles
- Rain is not uncommon
