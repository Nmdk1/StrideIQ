|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Max sustainable for fixed distance/time |
| **Primary Stress** | Full-system |
| **Expected EF** | Not primary; outcome + recovery cost is key |
| **Misuse** | Doing too often; fitness test addiction |

## 12.2 Tune-Up Race

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Actual race, shorter than goal distance |
| **When** | 2-4 weeks before goal race |
| **Source G** | Teaches brain that racing is safe (Central Governor) |
| **Purpose** | Practice logistics, handle jitters, test fitness |
| **Misuse** | Treating as goal race; too much recovery needed |

## 12.3 Goal Race

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | The A race |
| **Primary Stress** | Full-system max effort |
| **Recovery** | Significant (proportional to distance) |

# ZONE 13: RECOVERY / RETURN-TO-RUN (Special)

**Purpose:** Injury rehabilitation, conservative progression.

## 13.1 Rehab Run-Walk Ladder

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Progressive run segments with walk, week-to-week ramp |
| **Example** | Week 1: 1 min run / 2 min walk × 5 → Week 4: 5 min run / 1 min walk |
| **Primary Stress** | Mechanical tolerance |
| **Expected EF** | Ignore; symptom response rules |
| **Misuse** | Advancing volume before tissue is ready |

## 13.2 Diagnostic Run

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Short, easy run to assess injury status |
| **Purpose** | Test readiness, not train |
| **Expected EF** | Irrelevant; pain/symptoms are the metric |
| **Context** | Michael's December 14-31 runs post-injury |
| **Misuse** | Pushing to "prove" readiness |

## 13.3 Frequency First Block (Post-Injury)

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Structure** | Short easy runs, high frequency (daily or near-daily) |
| **Duration** | 15-30 min each |
| **Primary Stress** | Mechanical adaptation |
| **Expected EF** | May look unimpressive; consistency is the metric |
| **Misuse** | Adding intensity too soon |

# Detection Logic Summary

To classify variations correctly, the classifier must analyze:

| Signal | Used For |
|--------|----------|
| **Duration** (total vs segment) | Easy vs Long vs Workout |
| **Intensity** (HR zone or pace zone) | Zone classification |
| **Rest Ratio** (work:rest) | Intervals vs Tempo vs Reps |
| **Rest Intensity** (standing vs jog vs float) | Cruise vs VO2 vs Reps |
| **Progression Pattern** | Progression runs, cutdowns |
| **Interval Count + Length** | Interval type |
| **Elevation Profile** | Hill workouts |
| **Splits Pattern** | Even, positive, negative |
| **Context** (phase, recent load) | Recovery vs Easy vs Steady |

---

# Confidence Tagging

Every classification should include confidence:

| Confidence | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Clear pattern match, unambiguous data |
| **MEDIUM** | Reasonable match, minor ambiguity |
| **LOW** | Best guess, multiple interpretations possible |
| **UNKNOWN** | Cannot classify; needs athlete input |
