# Source E - Adaptive Running Philosophy

## Core Philosophy

> "Every runner needs to be a coach."

The most valuable coaching service is NOT sharing training knowledge - it's helping runners gain **knowledge of themselves**.

## The Two Classic Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Following Someone Else's Recipe
Blindly mimicking the training of champions without understanding:
- Your individual strengths and weaknesses
- Your unique needs and goals
- What made THEM successful (often different than their workouts)

### Mistake #2: Guiding Training by Plans, Not Responses
Training by the calendar instead of by how your body responds.
- Ignoring what your body is telling you
- Sticking to the plan even when it's destroying you

## The Adaptive Running Method

### Responsiveness Over Rigidity
> "Rather than relying on cookie-cutter regimens with weeks of prescribed mileage and workouts set in stone, see how a runner is responding to training before deciding what the next step should be."

### Each Runner is Unique
Variables that differ between runners:
- Running experience
- Training history
- Relative speed, strength, endurance
- Injury patterns
- Recovery capacity

**"No two runners should train in precisely the same way."**

## The Importance of Customization

A runner with more natural speed than endurance should NOT train the same as a runner with more natural endurance than speed - even with the same goal time.

A runner with 1 year of experience should NOT train the same as a runner with 12 years - even with the same goal and age.

## Training Types

### Aerobic-Support Training
Building the foundation

### Muscle Training
Strength and power development

### Specific-Endurance Training
Race-specific preparation

## Self-Assessment

Emphasizes constant self-evaluation:
- How am I responding to this training?
- What does my body need today?
- Am I improving or wearing down?

## The Coach's Role

The biggest job is NOT to show the one true path, but to help runners discover their own unique, ever-changing road to improvement.
