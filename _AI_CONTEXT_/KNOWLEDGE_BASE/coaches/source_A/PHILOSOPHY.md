# Source A - Training Philosophy

## Core Principles

### Marathon Success Factors (In Order of Importance)
1. **High Lactate Threshold (LT)** - Most important for any event >30 minutes
2. **Glycogen Storage + Fat Utilization** - Fuel for 26.2 miles
3. **Running Economy** - Oxygen efficiency at marathon pace
4. **High VO2max** - Aerobic ceiling
5. **Quick Recovery** - Ability to absorb training

### The Science-Based Approach
- Training must be based on exercise physiology, not folklore
- Every workout should have a clear physiological purpose
- Understand WHY you're doing each session, not just WHAT

### Key Workout Categories
1. **Long Runs** - Build endurance, glycogen storage, fat utilization
2. **Medium-Long Runs** - Aerobic development without full long run stress
3. **Marathon-Pace Runs** - Race-specific preparation, mental confidence
4. **General Aerobic Runs** - Build volume safely
5. **LT Runs** - Raise lactate threshold (the key marathon limiter)
6. **VO2max Intervals** - Raise aerobic ceiling
7. **Recovery Runs** - Active recovery, maintain frequency
8. **Speed Training** - Hill sprints, strides for neuromuscular recruitment

### Periodization Philosophy
Divides training into 4 blocks:
1. **Block 1: Endurance** - Build aerobic base, introduce strides/hills
2. **Block 2: LT + Endurance** - Threshold development while maintaining volume
3. **Block 3: Race Preparation** - VO2max sharpening, marathon-pace work
4. **Block 4: Taper + Race** - Reduce fatigue, maintain fitness

### Weekly Structure Principles
- Rest or cross-train on recovery days
- Hard days followed by recovery
- Long runs typically on weekends
- Avoid 3 demanding days in 4-day span
- Built around typical work schedule

### Masters Runner Adaptations
- **Stride length decreases with age** due to reduced ankle power
- Hill sprints and strides CRITICAL for maintaining stride length
- Strength training more important (2x/week)
- May need to extend schedule for recovery
- Sleep becomes more critical (8-9 hours vs 6-7)
- Easy runs should be SLOWER

### Tapering Philosophy
- Corrects accumulated wear and tear
- Improves running economy and muscle power
- Repairs microcellular damage
- Replenishes glycogen stores
- Bolsters immune system
- Duration: ~3 weeks for marathon
