# Source A - Workout Definitions

## Long Runs
- **Purpose:** Build endurance, glycogen storage, fat utilization
- **Distance:** 16-22 miles (varies by plan tier)
- **Pace:** Conversational, aerobic
- **Progression:** Build throughout plan, peak 2-3 weeks before race

## Medium-Long Runs
- **Purpose:** Additional aerobic development without full long run stress
- **Distance:** 11-15 miles
- **Pace:** Conversational, slightly faster than long runs
- **Frequency:** 1 per week in higher mileage plans

## Marathon-Pace Runs
- **Purpose:** Race-specific preparation, pacing practice, mental confidence
- **Structure:** Long run with significant portion at goal marathon pace
- **Examples:**
  - 15-16 miles with 10 miles at marathon pace
  - 16-17 miles with 12 miles at marathon pace
  - 19-22 miles with 14 miles at marathon pace
- **Timing:** Peaks 4-6 weeks before race, reduced in taper

## General Aerobic Runs
- **Purpose:** Build aerobic base, accumulate volume safely
- **Distance:** 7-11 miles
- **Pace:** Comfortable, can maintain conversation
- **Heart Rate:** 62-75% max HR

## LT (Lactate Threshold) Runs
- **Purpose:** Raise lactate threshold - THE key marathon limiter
- **Structure:** Warm-up, sustained effort, cool-down
- **Formats:**
  - Continuous: 20-40 minutes at LT pace
  - Tempo intervals: e.g., 25-30 min sustained
- **Pace:** "Comfortably hard" - faster than marathon pace, sustainable for ~1 hour
- **Feeling:** Controlled discomfort, not all-out

## VO2max Intervals
- **Purpose:** Raise aerobic ceiling, improve oxygen transport
- **Structure:** Intervals at 5K race pace with recovery jogs
- **Examples:**
  - 5 x 1km at 5K pace, jog 50-90% of interval time
  - 5 x 600m at 5K pace
  - 6 x 800m at 5K pace
- **Timing:** Introduced in Race Prep block, peaks 3-4 weeks before race

## Recovery Runs
- **Purpose:** Active recovery, maintain running frequency
- **Distance:** 4-6 miles
- **Pace:** Easy, truly comfortable
- **Rule:** If legs feel heavy, go even slower

## Speed Training
### Hill Sprints
- **Purpose:** Neuromuscular recruitment, power development, stride maintenance
- **Structure:** 6-10 x 10 seconds on moderate hill
- **Effort:** Near maximal
- **Timing:** Throughout training, especially base phase

### Strides
- **Purpose:** Leg turnover, running form, neuromuscular activation
- **Structure:** 6-10 x 100m accelerations
- **Effort:** Fast but controlled, not all-out sprint
- **Recovery:** Walk/jog back
- **Timing:** 2-3x per week, often added to easy runs
