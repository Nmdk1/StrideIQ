# Verde Track Club - Coaching Philosophy

**Source:** [verdetrackclub.com](https://www.verdetrackclub.com/)

## Background

Founded by Jonathan Green after his competitive career was cut short by chronic injuries. Based in Flagstaff, Arizona - a premier altitude training location.

### Credentials
- BA in Psychology and Sociology (Georgetown)
- Master's in Sports Industry Management (Georgetown)
- Coached Olympic Bronze Medalist at Tokyo 2020 Marathon
- Developed an athlete who qualified for the U.S. Olympic Team in her marathon debut

## Core Philosophy

> "A combination of holistic and scientific approaches towards training and racing."

### Two Pillars
1. **Holistic Approach** - Considers the whole athlete, not just training data
2. **Scientific Backing** - Evidence-based methods, not tradition or folklore

## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency Over Intensity
> "The club emphasizes consistency and enjoyment in training."

This is a recurring theme across successful coaching methodologies. Consistency requires:
- Sustainable training loads
- Injury prevention
- Mental freshness
- Life balance

### 2. Enjoyment is Non-Negotiable
Training that isn't enjoyable isn't sustainable. The club explicitly emphasizes **enjoyment** as part of their approach.

This aligns with:
- 80/20 philosophy (most training should feel good)
- Adaptive running (respond to how you feel)
- Long-term athlete development

### 3. For All Ability Levels
> "...has enabled amateur and professional athletes alike to meet with success."

The methodology isn't just for elites - it scales to:
- Olympic medals
- Boston Qualifiers
- First 5Ks
- Countless personal records

### 4. Individual Goal Setting
> "Jon is excited to guide each athlete to establish and reach their desired goals."

Athletes define their own goals. The coach's role is to guide them there - not impose external expectations.

## Results-Based Validation

The proof is in the outcomes:
- Olympic Bronze Medal (Marathon, Tokyo 2020)
- U.S. Olympic Team qualification (athlete's marathon debut)
- Boston Qualifiers
- First-time 5K finishers
- Personal records across distances

## Why This Matters for StrideIQ

Verde TC validates our approach:

| Verde TC Principle | StrideIQ Alignment |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Holistic + Scientific | N=1 data + coaching wisdom |
| Consistency & Enjoyment | Easy must be easy |
| All ability levels | Plans for every runner |
| Individual goals | Athlete-first design |

## Notable Insight: From Injury to Coaching

The founder's transition from injured athlete to coach mirrors a pattern we see in many great coaches. The experience of injury creates:
- Deeper understanding of limits
- Appreciation for sustainable training
- Focus on what actually works vs. what's popular
