## Core Philosophy

### 1. "My Job Is to Eliminate My Own Job"

> "My goal with coaching people is to teach them and have them understand why we're doing what we're doing so if I ever stop coaching them, or for whatever reason we part ways, that they are basically able to coach themselves the same way I was coaching them previously. My job is to eliminate my own job, I guess."
> — Jon Green, Morning Shakeout Podcast

The coach's role is to make the athlete self-sufficient. Every training decision comes with an explanation of WHY. The athlete doesn't just follow a plan — they understand the reasoning behind it. Over time, the athlete develops their own coaching instincts.

**StrideIQ alignment:** This IS our mission — "empowering the athlete to be their own AI-assisted super coach." The system's value is surfacing the patterns, data, and reasoning the athlete can't hold in their head. Not replacing their judgment.

### 2. Volume Over Intensity — Conservative by Design

> "She was handling the mileage, but the intensity was bogging her down fatigue-wise."
> — Jon Green on Molly Seidel, Women's Running

> "I would say my training is probably a little bit more conservative than other coaches in the athletics world, but so far, I've had some good success with it and yeah, I'm going to continue to coach that way until I find a better way, essentially."
> — Jon Green, Running for Real Podcast

Green's most distinctive training shift: increase mileage, decrease intensity. Build the aerobic engine first. When in doubt, err on the conservative side with hard workouts. The fitness will come from consistency at moderate effort, not from hammering intervals.

This is NOT low-mileage easy running. Seidel built to 135 miles/week at altitude. It's HIGH volume at CONTROLLED intensity.

### 3. Listen to Your Body — Athlete Autonomy

> "The results will come if you just kind of constantly listen to your body, and then also relying on friends or mentors within the sport."
> — Jon Green, Running for Real Podcast

The athlete's feel is a first-class signal. When Seidel started working with Green, he sent two-week training blocks and she gave feedback. If something didn't work, they adjusted. It was a conversation, not a prescription.

**StrideIQ alignment:** Our Principle 4 — "The system INFORMS, the athlete DECIDES." The system surfaces data. The athlete, who knows their body, makes the call. Self-regulation is a signal, not a problem.

### 4. Check In on the Athlete, Not Just Results

From the I'll Have Another podcast discussion topics: "Checking in on the athlete versus just looking at results" was a specific segment. Green coaches the person, not the training log.

**StrideIQ alignment:** Our Principle 9 — "The system doesn't coach you on running. It coaches you on YOU." Holistic awareness of the athlete's state — not just metrics.

### 5. Enjoyment Is Non-Negotiable

> "You can have fun with it, enjoy it and still do well."
> — Jon Green, CITIUS Mag Podcast

Training that isn't enjoyable isn't sustainable. Green and Seidel maintain humor, lightness, and genuine friendship alongside Olympic-level rigor. The two are not in tension — the fun IS part of why the training works.

### 6. Figuring It Out Together

> "We don't always know what the right answer is, but it's been fun to figure it out and learn. Every marathon build, we've gotten a little bit more experience, a little knowledge into what we can expect or what might work."
> — Molly Seidel, Women's Running

> "It was just that open line of communication which made life really easy and made coaching her really easy."
> — Jon Green, Running for Real Podcast

The coaching relationship is collaborative. Not coach-dictates, athlete-follows. Each training cycle teaches both of them something. The system evolves based on what actually happens, not what the textbook says should happen.

**StrideIQ alignment:** This is the self-regulation tracking and supercompensation study. The system learns from every training cycle what works for THIS athlete.

### 7. Be a Sponge — Always Learning

> "It was just really leaning on my resources at the end of the day and not being afraid to ask people for help."
> — Jon Green, Running for Real Podcast

Green credits mentors like Mike Smith (Galen Rupp's coach) and Brandon Bonsey (Georgetown). He's confident in his choices but continuously learning. He doesn't claim to have all the answers. His psychology background (BA in Psychology and Sociology, Georgetown) informs his understanding of the whole athlete.

## Training Methodology (from Molly Seidel Case Study)

### The Transformation: Moderate Mileage + High Intensity → High Mileage + Controlled Intensity

**Before Green (Saucony Freedom Track Club):**
- ~80-100 miles/week
- Higher intensity workouts
- Training with middle-distance runners
- Injury-prone, modest results, battling burnout

**After Green (progressive build):**
- Late 2019: 110-115 miles/week (initial ramp)
- Pre-Olympics base: 125 miles/week
- Olympic build (Tokyo): ~135 miles/week at altitude (Flagstaff, 7,000ft)
- Post-Olympics (NYC Marathon): 120-130 peak weeks
- All at altitude in Flagstaff

### Intensity Philosophy: Threshold-Dominant, Conservative

> "Changing to more mileage-based training before adding intensity from tempos and threshold pace — and frankly never touching VO2max pace — is what really works better for me."
> — Molly Seidel, Women's Running

**What the harder workouts look like:**
- Mostly threshold work
- Long tempo runs
- Slower fartlek workouts
- Long repeats at half marathon race pace
- "Erred on the conservative side when it came to harder workouts"
- NO VO2max pace work (for Seidel specifically — N=1)

**Key insight:** Seidel is the type of runner who can race at a higher intensity level than she runs in her workouts. "That's just what works for her." Green didn't force a training model — he discovered what worked for the individual.

### Specific Workout Examples

**Long Run with Intensity (Marathon Build):**
- 8-12 miles around marathon race pace
- Surrounded by 3-mile gradual warmup + 3-mile slow cooldown
- Total: 14-18 miles
- Middle miles aren't rigid — slightly faster or slower depending on altitude, phase, fatigue

**Alternating Long Run Variation:**
- Middle 10 miles: alternating 1K efforts over and under marathon pace
- For Seidel: between 3:35 and 3:20-3:25/km for 16K
- With warmup and cooldown: 16 "zesty" miles total
- "A good way to group a long run effort and harder stimuli into one day"

**Double Threshold Day (Olympic Build):**
- AM: 8 x 1 mile at threshold, roads in Flagstaff (7,000ft elevation)
- PM: Similar or slightly faster workout on track in Sedona (4,350ft elevation)
- Progressing from ~5:25/mi to ~5:17/mi pace with 60sec rest
- High volume of quality, but pace is CONTROLLED — starting near MP, progressing to slightly faster than HMP
- "It's a lot of volume, but it isn't too much because the pace is controlled"

**Key: Below Lactate Threshold**
- "The key isn't the number of reps, but running smoothly and keeping the effort below lactate threshold."
- This is threshold-dominant training: high volume at controlled intensity, not low volume at max intensity.

**Rust-Buster Races:**
- Used sparingly for sharpening (e.g., Great North Run half marathon between builds)
- Not overraced — the focus stays on training

### Periodization Approach

**Mileage-first, intensity-second:**
1. Build mileage to target volume (months of patience)
2. Once mileage is established and athlete is running consistently, gently add workouts
3. Build-up intensity is conservative — threshold first, MP second
4. Training plans sent in two-week blocks with athlete feedback loop
5. Modified monthly/weekly/as-needed depending on relationship

**The Covid Gift (Seidel's progression):**
- Oct 2019: Started with Green, 110-115 mi/week, low intensity
- Jan 2020: 1:09:35 half marathon (fitness emerging)
- Feb 2020: 2:27:31 marathon debut, 2nd at Olympic Trials
- Mar 2020-Jul 2021: 16 months of continued base building (Covid delay)
- Built to ~135 mi/week at altitude
- Only added intensity in truncated 8-week build before London Marathon (Oct 2020): 2:25:13, 6th
- Olympic build: highest mileage + ever-so-carefully adding more intensity
- Aug 2021: Olympic Bronze Medal, Sapporo

**Key takeaway:** Patience. The delayed Olympics gave 16 months of uninterrupted base building. Green didn't rush the intensity. The fitness compounded through volume and consistency.

### What Green Does NOT Do

- Does not prescribe VO2max intervals (for Seidel — individual decision based on what works)
- Does not force a rigid periodization model
- Does not override athlete feel
- Does not separate coaching from friendship/relationship
- Does not claim to have all the answers

## Why This Coach Matters Most for StrideIQ

Jon Green's philosophy is the closest match to what StrideIQ is building:

| Green's Approach | StrideIQ Principle |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "My job is to eliminate my own job" — teach athletes to coach themselves | Empowering the athlete to be their own AI-assisted super coach |
| Volume over intensity, conservative by default | Conservative cold-start defaults, err on the side of NOT intervening |
| Listen to your body — athlete feel is paramount | The system INFORMS, the athlete DECIDES (Principle 4) |
| Check in on the athlete, not just results | Coach the person, not the metrics (Principle 9) |
| Two-week blocks with feedback, adjust based on response | Self-regulation tracking, learn from athlete overrides |
| "We don't always know the right answer, fun to figure it out" | Supercompensation study, continuous learning per athlete |
| N=1: "That's just what works for her" (no VO2max for Seidel) | N=1 over population norms (Principle 1) |
| Patience — months of base before intensity | System doesn't rush, learns individual response timelines |
| Friendship, humor, lightness alongside rigor | Tone rules: lead with positives, keep it human |
| All ability levels — Olympic medalists to first 5Ks | Plans for every runner, every distance |

**The founder's preference for Green's style should inform:**
- Default coaching tone (collaborative, not prescriptive)
- Default intensity philosophy (conservative, threshold-dominant, build aerobic base first)
- Default adaptation mode (inform, don't override — the athlete knows their body)
- How the coach explains the "why" behind every recommendation
- The system's posture toward the athlete: partner, not authority
