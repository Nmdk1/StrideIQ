# Source G - Speed Development Philosophy (5K Focus)

## The Core Insight

> "The 5K is a unique race that pairs the speed of a miler with the endurance of a marathoner."

Only a multifaceted approach targeting BOTH speed AND endurance will yield a faster 5K.

## Key Approach

Training for a faster 5K requires variety across multiple domains:
1. Training adjustments
2. Lifestyle adjustments
3. Race-day execution

There is NO single magic bullet.

## Key Principles

### Set Reasonable Goals
- Don't target impossible improvements
- Focus on incremental gains
- A 25:00 → 22:00 goal in one cycle is unrealistic
- Better goal: "Run faster than last time"

> "Improvement is always incremental and occurs at different rates for different runners."

### Goldilocks Volume & Intensity
Neither extreme works:
- Pure volume (150-200 miles/week) 
- Pure intensity (all intervals, minimal distance)

**The answer:** Balance both.

### Slow Down Your Distance Runs
Easy runs should be EASY.

### Split Tempo Runs into Repetitions
Tempo intervals > continuous tempo for 5K training.

### Include VO2max Workouts
Critical for 5K performance - it's a VO2max-limited event.

### Schedule Short Repetitions/Intervals
Speed development requires fast running.

### Hill Work
Both uphill and downhill running have their place.

### Lengthen Your Long Run
Aerobic base matters even for 5K.

### Goal-Pace Repetitions at the Right Time
Race-specific work belongs in the sharpening phase, not base.

### Sleep, Rest, Recover
Recovery is not optional.

## Masters Runners (Age 40+)

Key adjustments for older runners:
- Age-related adjustments ARE necessary
- But performance can still improve with proper training
- Different recovery needs
- Injury prevention becomes critical

## The Mindset

> "Training for a faster 5K has more to do with variety, fun, and self-confidence than it does with pain, discipline, and sacrifice."

### Positive Feedback Loop
- Don't create environments where incremental improvements feel like failures
- Celebrate smaller gains
- Long-term goals are fine, but primary focus should be on consistent improvement
