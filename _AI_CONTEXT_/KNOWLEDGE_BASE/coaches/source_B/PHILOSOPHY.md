# Source B - Training Philosophy

## Core Philosophy

> "What is the purpose of this workout?"

This is THE most important question a runner must answer before every session. If you can't answer it, don't do the workout.

## The Formula

### The Four Ingredients of Success (In Order)
1. **Inherent Ability** - Genetics (most important, least controllable)
2. **Intrinsic Motivation** - Internal desire to pursue the sport
3. **Opportunity** - Access to training, competition, support
4. **Direction** - Coaching, knowledge, structured approach

### Training Principles

1. **Greatest benefit from least stress** - Not maximum stress for maximum benefit
2. **Consistency over intensity** - Regular training beats sporadic hard work
3. **Individual adaptation** - Same program, different responses
4. **Purpose-driven sessions** - Every workout has a physiological goal
5. **Time-based thinking** - Use duration, not just distance

## Training Types (E, M, T, I, R)

Each type targets specific physiological adaptations:

| Type | % VO2max | % Max HR | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| E (Easy) | 59-74% | 65-79% | Base, recovery, heart development |
| M (Marathon) | 75-84% | 80-89% | Race-specific practice |
| T (Threshold) | 85-88% | 88-92% | Lactate clearance, endurance |
| I (Interval) | 95-100% | 98-100% | VO2max improvement |
| R (Repetition) | >100% | N/A | Speed, power, economy |

## Volume Guidelines

### Weekly Mileage Distribution
- **E running:** 65-80% of total volume
- **Quality sessions (T/I/R):** 15-25% of total volume
- **M running:** 10-20% when marathon training

### Session Limits (% of Weekly Mileage)
- **Long Run:** 25-30% (max 150 minutes)
- **M Pace:** 20% or 18 miles max
- **T Pace:** 10% in one session
- **I Pace:** 8% or 10K max
- **R Pace:** 5% or 5 miles max

## Heart Rate Cautions

Warns about using heart rate blindly:
- HR varies with heat, wind, terrain, fatigue
- Formulas (220-age) are often wrong for individuals
- Some athletes have max HR far from predicted

**Recommendation:** Test your actual max with repeated 2-minute uphill runs.

## Long Run Philosophy

- Minimum: 30 minutes
- Maximum: 150 minutes (2.5 hours)
- Elite marathoners don't run 5+ hour training runs
- Use TIME, not just distance, to limit long runs

## Recovery Philosophy

- Stay at same weekly mileage for 3-4 weeks before increasing
- Prefer step increases over gradual 10%/week increases
- Easy days are for accumulating miles AND recovering from quality days
- Days off ARE part of training, not missed training
