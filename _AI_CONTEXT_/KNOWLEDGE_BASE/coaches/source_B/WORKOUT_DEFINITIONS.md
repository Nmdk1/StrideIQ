# Source B - Workout Definitions (E/M/T/I/R System)

## E - Easy Running

### Purpose
- Build resistance to injury
- Strengthen heart muscle (stroke volume maximizes at ~60% max HR)
- Increase vascularization
- Develop muscle fiber characteristics for oxygen utilization

### Intensity
- 59-74% VO2max
- 65-79% max HR
- Conversational pace

### Guidelines
- Minimum: 30 minutes
- Maximum: 150 minutes (2.5 hours)
- Long runs: ≤25-30% of weekly mileage

### Notes
- Heart achieves max stroke volume at ~60% max HR - easy running IS working the heart
- If running fewer than 30 min, you spend more time showering than running
- Most benefits are a function of TIME at this intensity

## M - Marathon Pace Running

### Purpose
- Mental preparation for marathon pace
- Practice drinking at race pace
- Fuel utilization adaptation (teach body to conserve glycogen)

### Intensity
- 75-84% VO2max
- 80-89% max HR
- Can estimate: ~3 min/10K slower than 10K race pace

### Guidelines
- Maximum: 110 minutes or 18 miles (whichever first)
- Maximum per session: ≤20% of weekly mileage or 18 miles

---

## T - Threshold Running

### Purpose
- Improve lactate clearance ability
- Improve endurance (time at pace, not just pace)
- "Comfortably hard" - can hold for ~60 minutes when peaked

### Intensity
- 85-88% VO2max (well-trained)
- 80-86% VO2max (less trained)
- 88-92% max HR

### Two Formats

**Tempo Run:** Steady 20-minute run at T pace
- Better for mental confidence
- Proves you can sustain pace

**Cruise Intervals:** Repeated runs at T pace with short rests
- More total time at threshold intensity
- Work-to-rest ratio: ~5:1
- Examples: 5 × 1 mile T with 1 min rest; 3 × 2 mile T with 2 min rest

### Guidelines
- Maximum: 10% of weekly mileage in one session
- Tempo runs: ~20 minutes steady
- Cruise intervals: up to 30 minutes total if you can handle 20 min tempo

---

## I - Interval Training

### Purpose
- Maximize aerobic power (VO2max)
- Stress system at or near VO2max

### Intensity
- 95-100% VO2max
- 98-100% max HR
- 3K-5K race pace

### Key Insight: Reaching VO2max
- Takes ~90-120 seconds to reach VO2max from rest
- Optimal work bout: 3-5 minutes at I pace
- Can use shorter bouts (1-2 min) if recovery is SHORT
- Running FASTER doesn't help - you can't exceed VO2max benefit

### Guidelines
- Work bout duration: 3-5 minutes (preferred)
- Recovery: Equal to or slightly less than work bout
- Maximum: 8% of weekly mileage or 10K (whichever first)

---

## R - Repetition Training

### Purpose
- Improve anaerobic power
- Improve running speed
- Improve running economy

### Intensity
- Faster than I pace
- ~mile race pace or faster
- Must be RECOVERED enough to run fast with good form

### Key Principle
Running fast while struggling ≠ accomplishing the purpose.
Recovery must be adequate for QUALITY reps.

### Guidelines
- Work bout duration: ≤2 minutes
- Recovery: 2-3x work duration (or jog the distance run)
- Maximum: 5% of weekly mileage or 5 miles

### Typical Distances
- 200m, 300m, 400m, 500m, 600m
- 800m only if R pace is ~60 sec/400m or faster

---

## Strides

Short accelerations (20-30 seconds) used to:
- Maintain leg turnover
- Practice fast running with good form
- No significant physiological stress

Typically added at end of E runs: 4-6 × 20-30 sec
