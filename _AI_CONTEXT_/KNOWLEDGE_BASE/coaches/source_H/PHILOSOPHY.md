# Source H - Holistic Coaching Philosophy

**Source:** Flagstaff-based professional running collective

## Core Philosophy

> "A combination of holistic and scientific approaches towards training and racing."

### Two Pillars
1. **Holistic Approach** - Considers the whole athlete, not just training data
2. **Scientific Backing** - Evidence-based methods, not tradition or folklore

## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency Over Intensity
> "The club emphasizes consistency and enjoyment in training."

This is a recurring theme across successful coaching methodologies. Consistency requires:
- Sustainable training loads
- Injury prevention
- Mental freshness
- Life balance

### 2. Enjoyment is Non-Negotiable
Training that isn't enjoyable isn't sustainable. Explicitly emphasizes **enjoyment** as part of the approach.

This aligns with:
- 80/20 philosophy (most training should feel good)
- Adaptive running (respond to how you feel)
- Long-term athlete development

### 3. For All Ability Levels
> "...has enabled amateur and professional athletes alike to meet with success."

The methodology isn't just for elites - it scales to:
- Olympic medals
- Qualifying times
- First-time finishers
- Countless personal records

### 4. Individual Goal Setting
Athletes define their own goals. The coach's role is to guide them there - not impose external expectations.

## Results-Based Validation

The proof is in the outcomes across all ability levels.

## Notable Insight: From Injury to Coaching

The transition from injured athlete to coach mirrors a pattern we see in many great coaches. The experience of injury creates:
- Deeper understanding of limits
- Appreciation for sustainable training
- Focus on what actually works vs. what's popular
