# Source D - Training Philosophy

## The Core Concept: Cumulative Fatigue

> Training that doesn't allow for full recovery between training days.

This is NOT overtraining - it's strategic fatigue buildup through consistent training.

## The Five Components

1. **Mileage** - Strategic weekly volume
2. **Intensity** - Physiological adaptations
3. **Balance** - Proper distribution
4. **Consistency** - Day after day execution
5. **Active Recovery** - Running easy instead of resting

## Key Principles

### Run More Frequently
- Training 3-4 days/week → 6 days/week
- Add easy mileage, not more intensity
- Weekly mileage: ~3x race distance (35-45 miles for half marathon)

### The Long Run Philosophy

**Controversial position:** Long runs should NOT be the majority of weekly mileage.

The method caps long runs at 16 miles because:
1. Running 20+ miles on fresh legs doesn't simulate race conditions
2. The body is already fatigued from cumulative training
3. A 16-mile run on tired legs = 20+ miles on fresh legs
4. Prevents excessive recovery time that disrupts training flow

### Training on Tired Legs
The goal is to teach the body to:
- Perform when not fully recovered
- Simulate late-race fatigue
- Build mental toughness for final miles

### Why Other Plans Fail
Most plans:
- Put majority of mileage on weekends
- Make weekday runs high-intensity
- Leave no room for easy mileage accumulation
- Create feast-or-famine pattern

This method spreads mileage more evenly throughout the week.

## Volume Philosophy

| Race Distance | Weekly Mileage Multiplier |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| 5K | 4-6x race distance |
| Half Marathon | ~3x race distance |
| Marathon | ~2-2.5x race distance |

## The Domino Effect

If you omit one component, you interfere with the others:
- Miss easy days → can't recover for hard days
- Skip mileage → lose aerobic base
- Inconsistent training → no cumulative effect

## Active Recovery vs. Complete Rest

**Preference:** Easy running over days off
- Maintains blood flow
- Promotes recovery without losing consistency
- Keeps aerobic systems engaged
