# Knowledge Base Synthesis

**Last Updated:** January 10, 2026  
**Sources:** 8 established coaching methodologies + Michael Shaffer's data + Verde TC research  
**Status:** ACTIVE - Informs all plan generation

## Source Reference Key

| Code | Focus Area | Key Contribution |
|------|------------|------------------|
| Source A | Marathon preparation | Periodization, workout definitions, physiological reasoning |
| Source B | Training intensities | E/M/T/I/R system, pace-based prescription, volume limits |
| Source C | Intensity distribution | 80/20 principle, race pacing psychology |
| Source D | Cumulative fatigue | Strategic fatigue management, consistency over heroics |
| Source E | Adaptive training | Individualization, response-based adjustment |
| Source F | Science integration | Bridging research and practice, challenging dogma |
| Source G | Speed development | 5K focus, multi-faceted approach, goal setting |
| Source H | Holistic approach | Consistency + enjoyment, sustainability |
| Michael | Real-world data | Age philosophy, injury timing, N=1 validation |

## Universal Agreements

All sources agree on these principles:

### 1. Easy Must Be Easy
- Low intensity creates conditions for hard work to be productive
- Most runners go too hard on easy days
- Conversation test is the gold standard

### 2. Consistency Beats Intensity
- Adaptation is cumulative
- The athlete who trains year-round beats the one who trains in bursts
- Injury prevention enables consistency

### 3. Every Workout Has a Purpose
- Name the adaptation before you run
- Random stress doesn't produce targeted results
- "What is the purpose?" is not optional

### 4. Recovery Is Training
- Adaptation happens during rest
- Under-recovery = under-adaptation
- Sleep, nutrition, and rest days are not optional

### 5. Individualization Matters
- Same workout → different responses
- Population averages don't predict individual outcomes
- Response patterns must be tracked and used

## Key Tensions (Where Sources Disagree)

### Long Run Length
- **Source A:** 20-23 miles for marathon specificity
- **Source D:** 16 miles max (cumulative fatigue does the work)
- **Source B:** Time-based (150 min max)
- **Resolution:** Context determines. Cumulative fatigue runners benefit from shorter; fresh-legs runners need longer.

### VO2max Training
- **Source B:** Essential for raising aerobic ceiling
- **Source F:** Overrated as performance predictor
- **Resolution:** Useful for sharpening in peak phase, not primary driver for distance runners.

### Training Zones
- **Most sources:** Use zones for communication
- **Source F:** Zones are artificial boundaries on continuous spectrum
- **Resolution:** We use workout TYPES and EFFORT descriptions, never zone numbers.

### Long Run Intensity
- **Some sources:** Always easy
- **Others:** Progressive or with race-pace segments
- **Resolution:** Depends on weekly context. If quality during week, long run easy. If easy week, long run can have workout.

## Michael's Corrections to Conventional Wisdom

These insights override textbook recommendations when they conflict:

### 1. Age Is a Variable, Not a Limiter
- PRs at 57 prove age-based decline predictions are often wrong
- Individual data always overrides age-based assumptions
- What matters: cumulative fatigue, recovery patterns, injury history

### 2. Intervals: Timing > Activity
- Intervals are NOT inherently dangerous
- Injury occurs when intervals are introduced under high cumulative fatigue
- Safe: Intervals in base phase (fresh legs)
- Risky: Intervals mid-build (high volume, fatigued)

### 3. Easy Pace Calculators Are Too Aggressive
- Standard tables derive easy pace from race times
- Often too fast for actual easy running
- We emphasize the slower end of ranges

### 4. Speed Work Belongs in Base Phase
- Counterintuitive but proven by data
- Fresh legs + speed work = adaptation without injury
- Build phase = T-work and MP (lower injury risk)

### 5. Mid-Mileage Runners Need Frequency, Not Intensity
- 40-55 mpw runners should prioritize 6 days/week
- Goal: mechanical and aerobic durability
- Build the base before adding aggressive workouts

## The StrideIQ Philosophy

### Core Belief
> The athlete is the experiment. The data is the truth. The methodology is the servant.

### The Five Pillars
1. Easy must be easy
2. Every workout has a purpose
3. Consistency beats intensity
4. Recovery is training
5. The athlete is the blueprint

### Governing Documents
- **TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md** — Complete methodology with implementation rules
- **00_GOVERNING_PRINCIPLE.md** — Athlete-first plan design
- **workouts/WORKOUT_LIBRARY.md** — Unified workout definitions
- **workouts/VARIATION_LIBRARY.md** — Detailed variation attributes

## Application to Plan Generation

### For Fixed Plans (Free/$5)
- Follow TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md exactly
- Use effort descriptions when paces unknown
- Provide Training Pace Calculator link for personalization
- Structure: Base → Build → Peak → Taper with cut-backs

### For Custom Plans
- Start with athlete's data (Strava/Garmin)
- Identify response patterns
- Blend methodologies based on individual needs
- Adjust weekly based on actual performance

### For Guided Coaching
- Real-time adjustment
- Phase-appropriate workout selection
- Individual injury history integration
- Continuous feedback loop

## What Makes Us Different

| Traditional Apps | StrideIQ |
|------------------|----------|
| "Pick a plan" | "Here's what YOUR data says" |
| Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3 | Easy, Threshold, MP (types) |
| Age = limitation | Age = variable |
| Cookie-cutter templates | Individual response patterns |
| Trust the process | Trust your data |

## The Test

Before any recommendation:
> "Why does this fit THIS athlete specifically?"

**Wrong answer:** "Because Source A says so"  
**Right answer:** "Because this athlete's data shows X, and this approach addresses X"
