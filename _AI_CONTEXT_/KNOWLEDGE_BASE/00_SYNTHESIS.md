# Knowledge Base Synthesis

## Universal Agreements Across All Sources

### 1. Easy Running Must Be Easy
**Unanimous.** Every methodology emphasizes this.
- 59-74% VO2max for easy runs
- 80% of training below ventilatory threshold
- Recovery runs are RECOVERY
- Don't make every run "count" by pushing

### 2. Consistency Beats Intensity
**Unanimous.** Sustainable training > sporadic heroics.
- Cumulative fatigue from daily running builds adaptation
- 80/20 intensity distribution is sustainable and repeatable
- "Improvement is always incremental"

### 3. Individualization is Critical
**Unanimous.** Cookie-cutter plans fail.
- "No two runners should train the same way"
- Fiber type, recovery capacity, injury patterns differ
- Same workout affects runners differently

### 4. Purpose-Driven Training
**Unanimous.** Every session should have a clear "why."
- "What is the purpose of this workout?"
- Each workout type targets specific adaptations
- Know the adaptation you're seeking

### 5. Recovery is Training
**Unanimous.** Adaptation happens during rest.
- "Without adequate recovery, athletes face diminished returns"
- Periodic recovery weeks, sleep emphasis
- Active recovery preferred over complete rest

## Key Tensions Between Methodologies

### 1. Intensity Distribution

| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Source C | 80/20 strict rule |
| Source F | No magic zones, spectrum of intensity |
| Source D | More moderate intensity acceptable |

**StrideIQ Position:** We favor the 80/20 principle but describe it through workout TYPES, not percentages.

### 2. Long Run Philosophy

| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Source A | Long runs to 22-23 miles |
| Source D | Cap at 16 miles (cumulative fatigue theory) |
| Source B | Max 150 minutes (time-based) |

**StrideIQ Position:** Long run should serve the athlete's specific needs. For marathoners, 20-22 miles is typically appropriate; shorter for cumulative fatigue builds.

### 3. VO2max Training

| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Source B | Critical, targets aerobic ceiling |
| Source F | Overrated, not the primary driver |
| Source A | Part of race preparation phase |

**StrideIQ Position:** VO2max work has its place but isn't the primary driver for most distance runners.

### 4. Volume vs. Intensity Debate

| Source | Position |
|--------|----------|
| Source A | Volume primary |
| Some researchers | High-intensity optimal |
| Source F | Both are right in context |

**StrideIQ Position:** Volume builds the base; intensity sharpens. The ratio shifts with periodization.

## The StrideIQ Corrections

Based on Michael's experience and principles:

### 1. Age is a Variable, Not a Limiter
Prevailing wisdom says older = slower, less intensity, more rest.
**Our data:** PRs at 57, beating most 41-year-olds.
Age informs initial assumptions but individual data overrides.

### 2. Intervals Are Not Inherently Dangerous
Common belief: Intervals cause injury in older runners.
**Our finding:** Injury risk is from TIMING, not activity. Intervals in base (fresh legs) = safe. Intervals mid-build (high fatigue) = injury risk.

### 3. Training Zones Are a Crutch
All methodologies use zones to communicate.
**Our position:** Zones misrepresent physiology. We use workout TYPES and effort DESCRIPTIONS instead of rigid zone classifications.

### 4. Easy Paces from Standard Calculators Are Too Fast
Standard tables calculate easy pace from race performances.
**Our finding:** These are often too aggressive. Easy should be truly EASY - conversational, never questioned.

## How We Apply This Knowledge

### Plan Generation
1. Use established structure for periodization
2. Apply 80/20 intensity distribution
3. Individualize based on athlete data
4. Age-adjust recovery, not structure
5. No magic zones - workout types instead

### Athlete Communication
1. Describe effort qualitatively ("conversational," "comfortably hard")
2. Use Training Pace Calculator for specific paces WHEN NEEDED
3. Emphasize the WHY of each workout
4. Track response, not just execution

### Analysis
1. Compare expected vs. actual RPE (our unique contribution)
2. Look for patterns in individual data
3. Override population research when individual data conflicts
4. Track what actually works for EACH athlete
