# Plan Generation Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 11, 2026  
**Purpose:** Systematic extraction of knowledge base → plan generation rules  
**Status:** GOVERNING DOCUMENT for archetype creation

## Overview

This document extracts RULES from the knowledge base that must be followed when generating plans. Every decision in a plan should trace back to a principle here.

---

## Part 1: Source-Derived Rules

### From Source A (Marathon Preparation)

**Rule A1: Four-Block Periodization**
```
Block 1: ENDURANCE (Base)
  - Build aerobic foundation
  - Introduce strides and hill sprints
  - NO threshold yet
  - Duration: 3-4 weeks

Block 2: LT + ENDURANCE (Build)
  - Threshold development
  - Maintain volume
  - Duration: 4-6 weeks

Block 3: RACE PREPARATION (Peak)
  - VO2max sharpening (sparingly)
  - Marathon-pace work
  - Duration: 3-4 weeks

Block 4: TAPER + RACE
  - Reduce fatigue
  - Maintain fitness
  - Duration: 3 weeks
```

**Rule A2: Marathon Success Factors (Priority Order)**
1. High Lactate Threshold → T-work is the core quality
2. Glycogen Storage + Fat Utilization → Long runs
3. Running Economy → Strides, hills, drills
4. High VO2max → Intervals (Block 3 only)
5. Quick Recovery → Easy running, sleep

**Rule A3: Weekly Structure**
- Rest or cross-train on recovery days
- Hard day → Recovery day (never back-to-back hard)
- Long runs on weekends
- Never 3 demanding days in 4-day span

**Rule A4: Masters Adaptations**
- Hill sprints and strides CRITICAL (maintaining stride length)
- Strength training 2x/week
- Easy runs should be SLOWER than younger runners
- May need extended schedule for recovery
- Sleep: 8-9 hours (vs 6-7 for younger)

**Rule A5: Taper**
- Duration: ~3 weeks for marathon
- Purpose: Correct accumulated wear, improve economy, repair damage
- Replenish glycogen, bolster immune system

### From Source B (Training Intensities)

**Rule B1: Volume Limits (% of Weekly Mileage)**

| Session Type | Maximum | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| Long Run | 25-30% | Max 150 minutes |
| Marathon Pace | 20% or 18mi | Whichever is less |
| Threshold | 10% | In one session |
| Intervals | 8% or 10K | Whichever is less |
| Repetitions | 5% or 5mi | Whichever is less |

**EXAMPLE for 50 MPW:**
- Long run max: 12.5-15 miles (but 150 min cap)
- MP max: 10 miles or 18mi → 10 miles
- T max: 5 miles in one session
- I max: 4 miles
- R max: 2.5 miles

**Rule B2: Weekly Distribution**
- Easy running: 65-80% of volume
- Quality sessions (T/I/R): 15-25%
- Marathon pace: 10-20% when marathon training

**Rule B3: Time-Based Limits**
- Long run: 150 minutes maximum
- Elite marathoners don't do 5+ hour training runs
- Use TIME, not just distance

**Rule B4: Recovery Philosophy**
- Stay at same weekly mileage 3-4 weeks before increasing
- Prefer step increases over gradual 10%/week
- Days off ARE training, not missed training

**Rule B5: Purpose First**
> "What is the purpose of this workout?" — If you can't answer, don't do it.

---

### From Source C (80/20 Intensity Distribution)

**Rule C1: The 80/20 Principle**
- 80% of training at low intensity (conversational)
- 20% at moderate-to-high intensity
- Elite athletes across ALL endurance sports converge on this
- This is optimal adaptation pattern, not coincidence

**Rule C2: The Trap**
- Recreational runners tend toward 50/50 (too much moderate)
- Creates chronic fatigue without recovery to adapt
- The "moderate hole" is the enemy

---

### From Source D (Cumulative Fatigue)

**Rule D1: Cumulative Fatigue Approach**
- Race day: 26.2 on tired legs
- 20 miles on fresh legs ≠ race simulation
- 16 miles after days of consistent running = better simulation
- Strategic weekly volume > single heroic long runs

**Rule D2: Long Run Cap (Cumulative Philosophy)**
- Some coaches cap at 16 miles (let fatigue do the work)
- Context determines: Fresh-legs runners need longer; cumulative-fatigue runners benefit from shorter

---

### From Michael's Data (Real-World Corrections)

**Rule M1: Age Is a Variable**
- PRs at 57 prove age predictions often wrong
- Individual data overrides age assumptions
- What matters: cumulative fatigue, recovery patterns, injury history

**Rule M2: Interval Timing**
- Intervals are NOT inherently dangerous
- Risk = intervals + high cumulative fatigue
- Safe: Intervals in BASE (fresh legs)
- Risky: Intervals in BUILD (high volume, fatigued)

**Rule M3: Speed Work Placement**
- Counterintuitive: Speed work in BASE phase
- Fresh legs + speed = adaptation without injury
- BUILD phase = T-work and MP (lower injury risk)

**Rule M4: Mid-Mileage Runners Need Frequency**
- 40-55 mpw runners: prioritize 6 days/week
- Goal: mechanical and aerobic durability
- Build base before aggressive workouts

**Rule M5: Easy Pace Calculators Are Too Fast**
- Standard tables too aggressive for easy running
- Use slower end of ranges
- Conversation test > calculated pace

## Part 2: Derived Plan Structure Rules

### Phase Allocation (18-Week Marathon)

Based on Source A 4-block + cut-back rhythm:

| Phase | Weeks | Source A Block | Focus |
|-------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Base | 1-3 | Block 1: Endurance | Aerobic foundation, strides, hills |
| Cutback | 4 | — | Recovery, absorption |
| Threshold | 5-7 | Block 2: LT + Endurance | T-block progression |
| Cutback | 8 | — | Recovery |
| MP Integration | 9-11 | Block 3: Race Prep | Marathon pace introduction |
| Cutback | 12 | — | Recovery |
| Race Specific | 13-15 | Block 3: Race Prep | Extended MP, dress rehearsals |
| Taper | 16-18 | Block 4: Taper | Reduce fatigue (Source A says 3 weeks) |

### Volume Calculation (Based on Rule B1)

For a 50 mpw peak plan:

```
Weekly Distribution:
- Easy running: 32.5-40 miles (65-80%)
- Quality: 7.5-12.5 miles (15-25%)
- MP: 5-10 miles (10-20%)

Session Limits:
- Long run: ≤15 miles (30%)
- MP in long: ≤10 miles (20%)
- T session: ≤5 miles (10%)
```

### T-Block Progression (From TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md)

```
Week 1: 6 × 5 min @ T, 2 min jog
Week 2: 5 × 6 min @ T, 2 min jog
Week 3: 4 × 8 min @ T, 2 min jog
Week 4: 3 × 10 min @ T, 3 min jog
Week 5: 2 × 15 min @ T, 3 min jog
Week 6: 30-40 min continuous @ T
```

Scaling for 5-day/lower volume plans: Start at 5x5min instead of 6x5min.

### MP Progression (From TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md)

```
Base:  No MP in long runs (easy only)
Build: Start with 4 miles @ MP (inside long run)
Peak:  Progress to 6-8 @ MP
Dress Rehearsal: 8-14 @ MP continuous
```

**Rule: Total MP before race day should be 40-50+ miles**

---

## Part 3: Weekly Structure Rules

### Option A: Intensity Week + Easy Long (From TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md)

Use when: T-work is the week's quality session

```
Sunday:    Long run (easy)
Monday:    Rest / Gym / Cross-train
Tuesday:   Medium-long easy OR easy
Wednesday: Easy
Thursday:  QUALITY (T-work or hills)
Friday:    Easy
Saturday:  Easy (pre-long run)
```

### Option B: Easy Week + Workout Long

Use when: MP work is in the long run (no T that week)

```
Sunday:    Long run WITH workout (MP blocks)
Monday:    Rest / Gym
Tuesday:   Easy (recovery from LR)
Wednesday: Easy
Thursday:  Easy + strides (no T)
Friday:    Easy
Saturday:  Easy
```

### The Alternation Rule

From TRAINING_PHILOSOPHY.md:
> If there are two intense sessions during the week, the long run is easy.
> If only one intense session, the long run can also have a workout.
> Never three quality days.

**Implementation:**
- Week with T on Thursday → Long run easy (Structure A)
- Week with MP in long run → Thursday easy (Structure B)
- Alternate structures in Build 2 and Peak phases

## Part 4: Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any archetype, verify:

### Volume Distribution
- [ ] Easy running = 70-80% of weekly volume
- [ ] No session exceeds Source B limits (Rule B1)
- [ ] Long run ≤30% of weekly volume OR ≤150 minutes

### Periodization
- [ ] Base phase has NO threshold (strides/hills only)
- [ ] T-block shows progression (intervals → continuous)
- [ ] MP work progresses (4mi → 8mi → 14mi)
- [ ] Speed work (intervals) only in base phase
- [ ] Cut-back every 4th week (or 3rd for masters)

### Weekly Structure
- [ ] Never 3 quality days
- [ ] Hard day always followed by easy/rest
- [ ] Long run day consistent (Sunday)
- [ ] MP long weeks have no T-work
- [ ] T weeks have easy long runs

### Taper
- [ ] 3 weeks for marathon (Source A)
- [ ] Volume decreases, some intensity maintained
- [ ] Strides throughout for neuromuscular activation

### Masters Considerations (if applicable)
- [ ] Strides and hills throughout (not just base)
- [ ] Speed work in base only (not build)
- [ ] Consider every-3rd-week cutback
- [ ] May need extra recovery between quality

## Part 5: Applying to Plan Generation

### Step 1: Determine Volume Tier
From athlete data or questionnaire:
- Low: <30 mpw (5K/10K) or <40 mpw (HM/M)
- Mid: 30-50 mpw (5K/10K) or 40-65 mpw (HM/M)
- High: 50+ mpw (5K/10K) or 65+ mpw (HM/M)

### Step 2: Apply Volume Limits
Calculate session limits based on Rule B1:
```python
long_run_max = min(weekly_miles * 0.30, 150/pace_minutes_per_mile)
mp_max = min(weekly_miles * 0.20, 18)
t_max = weekly_miles * 0.10
```

### Step 3: Select Phase Structure
Use 4-block structure from Source A with cutbacks.

### Step 4: Apply T-Block Progression
Scale based on volume tier:
- Low: 4x4min → 2x12min
- Mid: 5x5min → 25min continuous
- High: 6x5min → 40min continuous

### Step 5: Apply MP Progression
Scale based on volume tier:
- Low: 2mi → 6mi → 8mi
- Mid: 4mi → 8mi → 14mi
- High: 6mi → 12mi → 18mi

### Step 6: Assign Weekly Structures
Alternate Structure A (T-week) and Structure B (MP-long week) in build/peak.

### Step 7: Validate Against Checklist
Run through Part 4 validation checklist.
