# Guided Self-Coaching Positioning

**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Product Positioning Enhanced

## Overview

Enhanced product positioning with "Guided Self-Coaching" concept — an additive refinement that amplifies the existing strong foundation without replacing or overhauling current messaging.

## Core Concept

**Guided Self-Coaching:**
- The athlete is in control — they coach themselves
- The system is the silent, intelligent guide: synthesizing the KB, personal data, and efficiency trends into evolving training
