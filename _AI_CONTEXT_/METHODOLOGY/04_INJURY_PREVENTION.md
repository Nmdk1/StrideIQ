## Core Principle

> "The best workout is the one you can recover from and build on."

Injured athletes can't train. Preventing injury is as important as the training itself.

---

## The 10% Rule

**Never increase weekly volume by more than 10%.**

| Current Week | Max Next Week |
|--------------|---------------|
| 20 miles | 22 miles |
| 30 miles | 33 miles |
| 40 miles | 44 miles |
| 50 miles | 55 miles |

**Exceptions:**
- Coming back from reduced weeks (can return to previous baseline faster)
- Adding a second run on a day (less stress than adding distance)

---

## Warning Signs

### Red Flags (Stop Training)
- Sharp, acute pain
- Pain that worsens during run
- Pain that changes your gait
- Swelling or visible injury
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that persists after stopping

### Yellow Flags (Reduce Load)
- Persistent soreness beyond 48 hours
- Pain at start of run that doesn't fade
- Declining performance despite rest
- Motivation crash
- Elevated resting heart rate (>5 bpm above baseline for 3+ days)

### Green Flags (Proceed)
- Normal muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Fatigue that recovers with sleep
- Minor tightness that warms up
- Consistent heart rate patterns

## Common Running Injuries

| Injury | Cause | Prevention |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Plantar Fasciitis | Overload, tight calves | Calf stretching, gradual volume |
| IT Band Syndrome | Weak hips, overstriding | Hip strengthening, cadence |
| Shin Splints | Too much too soon | Gradual progression, surface variety |
| Runner's Knee | Quad/hip weakness | Strength work, don't ignore pain |
| Achilles Tendinitis | Overuse, tight calves | Eccentric heel drops, calf work |
| Stress Fractures | High load, low recovery | Volume management, nutrition |

---

## Recovery Types

### 1. Mechanical Recovery
- **What:** Repair muscle damage, restore tissue
- **How:** Rest, sleep, easy movement
- **Timeline:** 24-72 hours after hard effort

### 2. Fuel Recovery
- **What:** Replenish glycogen, hydration
- **How:** Carbohydrates, protein, fluids
- **Timeline:** Immediate to 24 hours

### 3. Psychological Recovery
- **What:** Mental freshness, motivation
- **How:** Variety, non-running activities, social connection
- **Timeline:** Ongoing, especially after races

---

## Sleep

Sleep is the #1 recovery tool.

### Guidelines:
- **Minimum:** 7 hours
- **Optimal:** 8-9 hours for hard training
- **Quality:** Dark room, cool temperature, consistent schedule

### Signs of Sleep Debt:
- Elevated morning heart rate
- Reduced motivation
- Slower recovery
- Impaired decision-making
- Increased injury risk

---

## Adaptation Amplifiers

Things that HELP adaptation from training:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Sleep** | Primary recovery window |
| **Protein timing** | Muscle repair (within 2 hours post-run) |
| **Carbohydrate replenishment** | Glycogen restoration |
| **Easy movement** | Blood flow, recovery acceleration |
| **Heat/cold exposure** | Stress adaptation (when appropriate) |

---

## Adaptation Dampeners

Things that REDUCE adaptation from training:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs)** | Block adaptation signals |
| **Excessive ice** | Reduces natural healing response |
| **Artificial antioxidants** | May blunt training response |
| **Over-recovery** | Not enough stress = no adaptation |
| **Alcohol** | Impairs protein synthesis, sleep quality |

**Note:** Anti-inflammatories have their place for acute injury. Don't use them routinely to mask training soreness.

---

## Hard Workout Spacing

### Minimum Recovery Between Quality Sessions

| Workout Intensity | Days Before Next Quality |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Easy run | 0 (can train next day) |
| Tempo/Threshold | 1-2 days |
| VO2max Intervals | 2-3 days |
| Repetitions | 2-3 days |
| Race (5K-10K) | 5-7 days |
| Race (Half) | 10-14 days |
| Race (Marathon) | 21-28 days |

---

## Strength Work for Runners

Strength training reduces injury risk by:
- Correcting muscle imbalances
- Improving running economy
- Building resilience to impact

### Key Exercises:
| Exercise | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Single-leg squats | Quad/hip stability |
| Hip bridges | Glute activation |
| Calf raises (eccentric) | Achilles/calf strength |
| Planks | Core stability |
| Lateral band walks | Hip abductors |

### Frequency:
- 2x per week
- 15-20 minutes
- Not on hard running days

---

## Mobility & Flexibility

### Dynamic Warm-up (Before Runs)
- Leg swings
- Walking lunges
- Hip circles
- High knees
- Butt kicks

### Static Stretching (After Runs)
- Calf stretch
- Quad stretch
- Hip flexor stretch
- Hamstring stretch
- Glute stretch

**Timing:** Hold stretches 30-60 seconds after runs, not before.

---

## Listening to Your Body

### Questions to Ask Before a Run:
1. How did I sleep last night?
2. How do my legs feel right now?
3. Is my motivation normal?
4. Am I recovering from something (illness, stress)?
5. What does my body need today?

### Adjustment Options:
- **Feel great:** Proceed as planned
- **Feel okay:** Proceed, reassess mid-run
- **Feel tired:** Reduce intensity or duration
- **Feel terrible:** Skip or replace with easy walk

---

## Return from Injury Protocol

### Phase 1: Testing (Days 1-3)
- Short, easy runs
- Monitor for pain return
- Stop if pain >3/10

### Phase 2: Rebuilding (Weeks 1-2)
- 50% of previous volume
- All easy intensity
- No quality work

### Phase 3: Progression (Weeks 3-4)
- Increase volume 10% per week
- Introduce light strides
- Continue monitoring

### Phase 4: Full Training (Week 5+)
- Return to normal schedule
- Introduce quality carefully
- Address root cause

---

## Key Principles

1. **Prevention > Treatment** - Easier to avoid injury than recover from one

2. **Gradual Progression** - The 10% rule exists for a reason

3. **Listen to Signals** - Pain is information, not weakness

4. **Sleep is Training** - Recovery happens when you rest

5. **Strength Matters** - Strong runners are resilient runners

6. **Consistency Over Heroics** - Better to run 5x/week for years than 7x/week for months
