## Overview

Training zones provide a framework for prescribing workout intensities. This system synthesizes the best approaches from exercise science into a unified model that can be applied to any athlete.

---

## Zone Definitions

### Zone 1: Recovery
- **Intensity:** <75% Max HR, <66% HRR
- **RPE:** 1-3 out of 10
- **Breathing:** Easy, nasal possible
- **Purpose:** Active recovery, blood flow without stress
- **Duration:** 20-45 minutes
- **When:** After hard workouts, between quality days

### Zone 2: Easy / Aerobic
- **Intensity:** 72-81% Max HR, 62-74% HRR
- **RPE:** 3-4 out of 10
- **Breathing:** Conversational, full sentences
- **Purpose:** Build aerobic base, accumulate volume safely
- **Duration:** 30-90 minutes
- **When:** Majority of training volume (70-80%)

### Zone 3: Endurance / Long Run
- **Intensity:** 75-83% Max HR, 66-77% HRR
- **RPE:** 4-5 out of 10
- **Breathing:** Slightly labored, sentences harder
- **Purpose:** Endurance building, fat oxidation
- **Duration:** 60-180+ minutes
- **When:** Weekly long runs

### Zone 4: Threshold / Tempo
- **Intensity:** 83-90% Max HR, 77-87% HRR
- **RPE:** 6-7 out of 10
- **Breathing:** Rhythmic, words not sentences
- **Description:** "Comfortably hard"
- **Purpose:** Improve lactate clearance, sustainable speed
- **Duration:** 10-40 minutes continuous, or intervals
- **When:** 1-2x per week in build phase

### Zone 5: VO2max / Intervals
- **Intensity:** 93-95% Max HR, 91-94% HRR
- **RPE:** 8-9 out of 10
- **Breathing:** Heavy, focused
- **Purpose:** Increase aerobic power (VO2max)
- **Duration:** 3-5 minute intervals with equal recovery
- **When:** 1-2x per week, race-specific phase
- **Volume limit:** Max 8% of weekly mileage OR 10K total

### Zone 6: Repetition / Speed
- **Intensity:** 95-100%+ Max HR
- **RPE:** 9-10 out of 10
- **Purpose:** Speed, running economy, anaerobic power
- **Duration:** 200m-600m reps (<2 min each)
- **Recovery:** 2-3x work duration
- **When:** Race-specific and peak phase
- **Volume limit:** Max 5% of weekly mileage OR 5 miles total

## Heart Rate Zone Summary Table

| Zone | Name | % Max HR | % HRR | RPE |
|------|------|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Recovery | <75% | <66% | 1-3 |
| 2 | Easy | 72-81% | 62-74% | 3-4 |
| 3 | Endurance | 75-83% | 66-77% | 4-5 |
| 4 | Threshold | 83-90% | 77-87% | 6-7 |
| 5 | VO2max | 93-95% | 91-94% | 8-9 |
| 6 | Repetition | 95%+ | 94%+ | 9-10 |

---

## Race Pace Relationships

| Race Distance | Approximate Zone | Typical Intensity |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Marathon | Zone 4 (lower) | 81-88% Max HR |
| Half Marathon | Zone 4 | 83-88% Max HR |
| 10K | Zone 4-5 | 88-92% Max HR |
| 5K | Zone 5 | 93-95% Max HR |
| Mile | Zone 5-6 | 95-98% Max HR |

---

## Training Paces from Race Performance

Given a recent race performance, training paces can be derived:

| Training Type | Pace Reference |
|---------------|----------------|
| Easy/Recovery | 1:30-2:00/mi slower than marathon pace |
| Long Run Start | 20% slower than marathon pace |
| Long Run Finish | 10% slower than marathon pace |
| Threshold | ~10-15 sec/mi slower than 10K pace |
| Interval | 5K race pace |
| Repetition | Faster than 5K (1500m-mile pace) |

---

## Volume Limits for Quality Work

### VO2max Work (Zone 5)
- **Per session:** Max 8% of weekly volume OR 10K
- **Example:** 40 miles/week = max 3.2 miles at VO2max pace
- **Example:** 75 miles/week = cap at 10K

### Repetition Work (Zone 6)
- **Per session:** Max 5% of weekly volume OR 5 miles
- **Example:** 30 miles/week = max 1.5 miles at R pace
- **Individual reps:** Should NOT exceed 2 minutes

### Threshold Work (Zone 4)
- **Per session:** 10-15% of weekly volume
- **Example:** 50 miles/week = 5-7.5 miles at threshold

---

## Recovery Between Efforts

| Zone | Recovery Needed |
|------|-----------------|
| Zone 6 (Reps) | 2-3x work duration |
| Zone 5 (Intervals) | Equal to or slightly less than work duration |
| Zone 4 (Tempo) | 1-2 minute jogs between intervals |

---

## Progression Principles

### Building Volume
- Increase weekly volume by max 10% per week
- Every 4th week: reduce volume 20-30% (recovery week)
- Volume builds fitness; intensity sharpens it

### Long Run Progression
- Start: 10-12 miles
- Peak: 20-22 miles (experienced: one 24-miler)
- Allow 3 weeks before goal race for taper

### Intensity Progression
- Base phase: Minimal quality work (90%+ easy)
- Build phase: Introduce threshold work
- Peak phase: Add VO2max and race-specific work
- Taper: Reduce volume, maintain intensity

## Heart Rate Drift

During long runs, heart rate will naturally drift upward even at constant pace. This is normal due to:
- Dehydration
- Core temperature rise
- Glycogen depletion
- Cardiac drift

**Guideline:** If HR drifts >10% above target zone in a long run, the pace was too aggressive or conditions were too hot.

---

## Using RPE When HR is Unreliable

Heart rate can be unreliable due to:
- Heat/humidity
- Caffeine
- Stress
- Illness
- Altitude

In these conditions, use RPE as primary guide:
- Recovery: "Could do this all day"
- Easy: "Comfortable, conversational"
- Threshold: "Comfortably hard, focused"
- VO2max: "Hard, controlled suffering"
- Repetition: "Fast, barely sustainable"

---

## Key Principles

1. **Most training should be easy** - Zones 1-2 for 70-80% of volume
2. **Quality has limits** - Honor volume caps for high-intensity work
3. **Recovery is training** - Easy days enable hard days
4. **HR zones are guides, not gospel** - Adjust for conditions and feel
5. **Consistency beats heroics** - Regular moderate training > sporadic hard efforts
