# Training Periodization

*Performance Focused Coaching - Training Cycles*
*Last Updated: 2026-01-08*

## Overview

Periodization is the systematic planning of athletic training. It divides the training year into phases, each with specific goals, allowing for progressive overload and peak performance timing.

## The Training Hierarchy

```
CAREER (Years)
  └── SEASON (6-12 months)
        └── MACROCYCLE / BUILD (12-24 weeks)
              └── MESOCYCLE / BLOCK (3-6 weeks)
                    └── MICROCYCLE / WEEK (7 days)
                          └── SESSION / WORKOUT (1 day)
                                └── COMPONENT (intervals, sets)
```

## Season Structure

### Annual Plan (~12 months)

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Transition | 2-4 weeks | Recovery, cross-training |
| Base Building | 6-12 weeks | Volume, aerobic foundation |
| Build / Strength | 4-8 weeks | Introduce quality |
| Peak / Race-Specific | 2-4 weeks | Goal pace work |
| Taper | 1-3 weeks | Reduce volume, maintain intensity |
| Race | 1-2 weeks | Competition |
| Recovery | 1-4 weeks | Active rest |

---

## Phase Descriptions

### 1. Transition Phase (2-4 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Physical and mental recovery
- Maintain basic fitness
- Address injuries

**Characteristics:**
- Reduced volume (50-70% of peak)
- Low intensity
- Cross-training welcome
- No structured workouts

### 2. Base Building Phase (6-12 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Build aerobic capacity
- Increase volume gradually
- Establish consistency

**Characteristics:**
- 80-90% easy running
- Long runs building to moderate distances
- Strides for neuromuscular maintenance
- Weekly volume increases of 5-10%
- Recovery weeks every 3-4 weeks

**Weekly Structure Example:**
| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Mon | Off or cross-train |
| Tue | Easy run + strides |
| Wed | Easy run |
| Thu | Easy run |
| Fri | Easy or off |
| Sat | Long run |
| Sun | Easy run |

### 3. Build / Strength Phase (4-8 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Introduce threshold work
- Build fatigue resistance
- Develop race-specific fitness

**Characteristics:**
- 70-80% easy running
- 1-2 quality sessions per week
- Long runs with progression or tempo finish
- Hill work for strength

**Weekly Structure Example:**
| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Mon | Off or recovery |
| Tue | Tempo / Threshold |
| Wed | Easy run |
| Thu | Easy run + strides |
| Fri | Off or easy |
| Sat | Long run (progressive) |
| Sun | Easy run |

### 4. Peak / Race-Specific Phase (2-4 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Sharpen for goal race
- Practice race pace
- Build confidence

**Characteristics:**
- Goal pace work
- Race simulations
- Tune-up races (shorter distance)
- Maintain volume, increase intensity

**Weekly Structure Example:**
| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Mon | Off or recovery |
| Tue | VO2max intervals |
| Wed | Easy run |
| Thu | Goal pace work |
| Fri | Off or easy |
| Sat | Long run with race-pace segment |
| Sun | Easy run |

### 5. Taper Phase (1-3 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Reduce fatigue
- Maintain fitness
- Peak for race

**Characteristics:**
- Volume reduction: 40-60%
- Maintain some intensity
- Short, sharp sessions
- Extra rest and sleep

**Taper Guidelines:**
| Race Distance | Taper Length |
|---------------|--------------|
| 5K | 4-7 days |
| 10K | 7-10 days |
| Half Marathon | 10-14 days |
| Marathon | 14-21 days |

### 6. Recovery Phase (1-4 weeks)
**Goals:**
- Recover from race
- Heal micro-damage
- Recharge mentally

**Characteristics:**
- Easy running only
- Cross-training
- No structured workouts
- Listen to body

**Recovery Timeline:**
| Race Distance | Easy Days After |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 5K | 3-5 days |
| 10K | 5-7 days |
| Half Marathon | 10-14 days |
| Marathon | 14-28 days |

## Block Training Approach

An alternative to traditional periodization, focusing intensity in short blocks:

### Two-Week Block Structure
- **Week 1:** Load week (higher volume/intensity)
- **Week 2:** Absorption week (moderate, let adaptation happen)

### Benefits:
- More flexible than rigid weekly structure
- Allows for life variability
- Focuses on current fitness, not arbitrary targets

---

## Cumulative Fatigue Training

Training in a state of incomplete recovery to build race-specific fatigue resistance.

### Principles:
- Six days per week training
- "Something of Substance" (SOS) workouts 3x per week
- Never fully fresh for workouts
- Simulates race-day fatigue
- Taper reveals full fitness

### Warning:
- Requires careful monitoring
- Higher injury risk if overdone
- Not for beginners

---

## Adaptive Training

Rather than following a rigid plan, adjust based on:

### Daily Signals:
- Sleep quality
- Morning HR
- Energy level
- Muscle soreness
- Life stress

### Weekly Adjustments:
- Move hard days if not recovered
- Extend recovery if needed
- Reduce intensity before adding volume

### Key Question:
> "What does my body need today to improve?"

---

## Volume Progression

### Building Phase
- Week 1: Baseline
- Week 2: +5-10%
- Week 3: +5-10%
- Week 4: -20-30% (recovery week)
- Repeat

### Example (Starting 30 miles/week):
| Week | Volume |
|------|--------|
| 1 | 30 mi |
| 2 | 33 mi |
| 3 | 36 mi |
| 4 | 28 mi (recovery) |
| 5 | 37 mi |
| 6 | 40 mi |
| 7 | 44 mi |
| 8 | 34 mi (recovery) |

---

## Long Run Progression

### Base Phase
- Build to 14-16 miles
- All easy effort

### Build Phase
- Build to 18-20 miles
- Add progression elements
- Occasional tempo finish

### Peak Phase
- 20-22 miles (one 24-miler for experienced)
- Include race-pace segments
- Final long run: 3 weeks before race

---

## Quality Session Frequency

| Phase | Quality Sessions/Week |
|-------|----------------------|
| Base | 0-1 (strides only) |
| Early Build | 1 |
| Late Build | 2 |
| Peak | 2-3 |
| Taper | 1-2 (shorter) |

---

## Key Principles

1. **Stress + Rest = Adaptation**
   - Hard work creates stress
   - Recovery allows adaptation
   - Skip either and you don't improve

2. **Progressive Overload**
   - Gradually increase training stress
   - Body adapts to new normal
   - Too much too soon = injury

3. **Specificity**
   - Training should match goal race demands
   - Base builds capacity, specificity sharpens it

4. **Individualization**
   - Plans are templates, not prescriptions
   - Adjust based on response
   - What works for others may not work for you

5. **Reversibility**
   - Fitness gains are temporary
   - Use it or lose it
   - Consistency matters more than occasional heroics
