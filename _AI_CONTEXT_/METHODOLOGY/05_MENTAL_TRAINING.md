*Last Updated: 2026-01-08*

## Core Principle

> "The mind is often the limiter before the body."

Physical fitness sets the ceiling. Mental fitness determines how close you get to it.

---

## The Mental Performance Triangle

```
         CONFIDENCE
           /    \
          /      \
         /        \
    ENJOYMENT -- MOTIVATION
```

All three must be present for sustainable performance.

## Confidence

### What It Is
Belief in your ability to achieve your goals based on evidence.

### How to Build It
1. **Training Consistency** - Each workout is a deposit in the confidence bank
2. **Successful Workouts** - Hit your targets, build belief
3. **Process Focus** - Trust the training, not just outcomes
4. **Tune-up Races** - Practice success in lower-stakes settings
5. **Review Past Successes** - Remember what you've already done

### Warning Signs of Low Confidence
- Excessive doubt before workouts
- Avoiding goal-pace work
- Qualifying language ("I'll try to...")
- Over-focusing on competitors
- Changing plans frequently

---

## Enjoyment

### Why It Matters
> "If you don't enjoy it, you won't be consistent. If you're not consistent, you won't improve."

Enjoyment predicts:
- Training consistency
- Longevity in the sport
- Willingness to train through difficulty
- Recovery quality

### How to Cultivate It
1. **Variety** - Different routes, surfaces, workouts
2. **Social Running** - Run with others sometimes
3. **Achievement** - Celebrate milestones
4. **Autonomy** - Some choice in training
5. **Mastery** - Focus on improvement, not just outcomes

### Tracking Enjoyment
Simple 1-5 scale after runs:
- 5: Loved it, could do it again
- 4: Good, energized
- 3: Neutral, got it done
- 2: Struggled, didn't enjoy
- 1: Hated it, forced myself

**Pattern to watch:** Multiple 1-2 ratings = intervention needed

## Motivation

### Types of Motivation

| Type | Description | Sustainability |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Love of running itself | High |
| **Identified** | Aligns with personal values | High |
| **Introjected** | Guilt/shame-driven | Medium |
| **External** | Others' expectations | Low |

**Goal:** Build intrinsic motivation. External motivation fades.

### Motivation Strategies
1. **Set meaningful goals** - Personal, not imposed
2. **Connect to values** - Why does running matter to you?
3. **Celebrate progress** - Not just outcomes
4. **Vary the stimulus** - Prevent staleness
5. **Rest when needed** - Forced training kills motivation

## Pacing as a Mental Skill

### The Central Governor Theory
The brain regulates effort to prevent catastrophic failure. It's conservative. You almost always have more than you think.

### Implications
1. **The brain lies** - "I can't" is often "I don't want to"
2. **Practice counts** - Tune-up races teach you what's possible
3. **Start controlled** - Trust the plan, don't panic early
4. **Finish strong** - Reserve energy for the final push
5. **Pain is temporary** - It will end, finish lines exist

### Pacing Practice
- Goal-pace workouts
- Negative split training
- Race simulations
- Tune-up races

---

## Pre-Race Mental Prep

### Week Before
- Visualize the race (course, crowds, finish)
- Review training highlights
- Practice positive self-talk
- Reduce decision fatigue (plan logistics)

### Night Before
- Accept nerves as excitement
- Trust your preparation
- Focus on process, not outcome
- Limit race-day logistics thinking

### Morning Of
- Routine, routine, routine
- Warm-up activates body and mind
- Simple mantras ready
- Focus on first mile only

### During Race
- Process cues ("relax shoulders", "quick feet")
- Mile-by-mile thinking
- Save energy early, spend late
- Reframe pain as progress

---

## Dealing with Adversity

### Bad Workouts
- One bad workout means nothing
- Two bad workouts: check sleep, stress, nutrition
- Three bad workouts: adjust plan
- Pattern of bad workouts: reassess goals

### Bad Races
- Grieve briefly, then analyze
- What can you learn?
- What will you do differently?
- Don't let one race define you

### Injury
- Not a failure, a detour
- Focus on what you CAN do
- Use time for mental training
- Come back smarter, not just healed

---

## Mindset Tracking

### Daily Check-in (1-5 scale)
- **Enjoyment:** How much did I enjoy training?
- **Confidence:** How confident am I in my ability?
- **Motivation:** How motivated am I to train?

### Weekly Reflection
- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- What will I do differently?
- What am I proud of?

### Monthly Review
- Am I enjoying this?
- Is my confidence building?
- Are my goals still meaningful?
- What adjustments are needed?

## The Mind-Body Connection

### Physical → Mental
- Better fitness = more confidence
- Good sleep = better mood
- Proper nutrition = stable energy
- Overtraining = mental fatigue

### Mental → Physical
- Confidence = better performance
- Stress = elevated HR, poor recovery
- Enjoyment = consistency
- Fear = tension, inefficiency

---

## Key Principles

1. **Mental training IS training** - Not optional extra

2. **Enjoyment predicts success** - If you hate it, you'll quit

3. **Confidence is earned** - Built through consistent training

4. **The brain is conservative** - You have more than it says

5. **Process over outcome** - Control what you can control

6. **Rest is mental too** - Don't just rest your body

7. **Failure is information** - Learn and move forward
