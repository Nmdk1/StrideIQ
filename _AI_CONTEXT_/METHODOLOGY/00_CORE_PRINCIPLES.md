## Governing Principle

**Suit plans to athletes, not athletes to plans.**

Training philosophy has evolved beyond any single system. We synthesize the best of exercise science and apply it to the individual in front of us.

---

## The Five Pillars

### 1. Easy Must Be Easy

Most training should be at conversational effort. The purpose of easy running is to build aerobic capacity without creating fatigue that compromises quality sessions.

**Application:**
- Track if "easy" runs are actually easy (<75% max HR)
- Alert when easy runs drift to moderate intensity
- Don't let recovery runs become workouts

**Note:** The specific percentage split (80/20, 70/30) is less important than the principle. What matters is that easy days genuinely allow recovery.

---

### 2. Individualization is Everything

No two athletes respond identically to training. Age, experience, injury history, recovery capacity, life stress, and genetics all play a role.

**Application:**
- Build the athlete's individual performance model over time
- Compare athlete to THEMSELVES, not population averages
- Adapt recommendations based on how THIS athlete responds

---

### 3. Consistency Beats Intensity

Showing up day after day, week after week, month after month matters more than any single heroic workout. Injured athletes can't train.

**Application:**
- Track training streaks and consistency metrics
- Celebrate consistency, not just performance
- Flag patterns that precede injury

---

### 4. Context Changes Everything

The same pace/HR combo means different things in different contexts:
- Training phase (base vs. build vs. peak vs. recovery)
- Recent training load
- Life circumstances
- Weather/terrain
- Injury status

**Application:**
- Multi-scale analysis (7 days, 30 days, 120+ days, career)
- Phase-aware interpretation
- Don't alarm on intentional recovery

---

### 5. Show Patterns, Don't Prescribe

Present data and correlations. Let the athlete decide.

**Application:**
- "When you do X, Y tends to happen"
- Never "You should do X"
- Empower, don't dictate

---

## Training Intensity (Why We Don't Use "Zones")

> **Philosophy:** Your body operates on a continuous spectrum, not discrete zones.

Traditional "Zone 1-5" systems are pedagogical conveniences, not physiological realities:

- **Muscle fiber recruitment is continuous** - Type I, IIa, IIx fibers recruit based on force demand, not thresholds
- **Metabolic pathways overlap** - Aerobic, glycolytic, and phosphocreatine systems run simultaneously
- **"Lactate threshold" is a region** - Not a cliff where your body switches modes
- **Individual variation is massive** - What's "Zone 2" for you might be "Zone 3" for someone else
- **Day-to-day variation matters** - Sleep, stress, hydration, and fatigue shift everything

### What We Use Instead

| Instead of "Zones" | We Use | Why |
|-------------------|--------|-----|
| Zone 1-5 numbers | **Intensity score (0-100)** | Honest about the spectrum |
| "Zone 2 run" | **Easy run** | Describes intent, not internal state |
| HR threshold zones | **Effort descriptions** | "Very Easy" to "Maximum" |
| Zone-based prescriptions | **Workout types** | Tempo, intervals, long run |

### Effort Categories (for internal grouping only)

These are used to group similar workout types, NOT to tell athletes which "zone" they were in:

| Category | Effort Description | Purpose |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Recovery | Very Easy | Active recovery, blood flow |
| Endurance | Easy / Aerobic | Base building, most training volume |
| Stamina | Moderate / Threshold | Lactate clearance, sustained effort |
| Speed | Hard / High Intensity | VO2max, aerobic power |
| Maximum | Very Hard | Neuromuscular, economy |
| Race | Race Effort | Goal pace practice |

### What We Tell Athletes

> "When we say 'easy run,' we mean an effort where you could hold a full conversation. 
> When we say 'threshold,' we mean the fastest pace you could sustain for about an hour in a race.
> These are practical descriptions, not physiological buckets."

**Trust perceived effort.** Your brain integrates hundreds of signals we can't measure.

**Heart rate is a guide, not gospel.** It responds to many factors beyond intensity.

**See:** `_AI_CONTEXT_/KNOWLEDGE_BASE/01_INTENSITY_PHILOSOPHY.md` for full philosophy.

## Athlete Types

Athletes tend toward one of three profiles based on their race history:

| Type | Characteristics | Training Implications |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Speed-Dominant** | Better at shorter distances relative to longer | More endurance work needed in builds |
| **Endurance-Dominant** | Better at longer distances relative to shorter | Speed work needed for race sharpening |
| **Balanced** | Consistent across distances | Flexible training approach |

**Application:** Classify automatically from race history. Adjust training emphasis based on type AND goal race.

---

## Training Phases

### Base Building
- **Focus:** Volume, easy running, general fitness
- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks
- **Volume:** Gradually increasing

### Build / Strength
- **Focus:** Introduce quality, build fatigue resistance
- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks
- **Quality:** Tempo, threshold work

### Peak / Race-Specific
- **Focus:** Goal pace work, race simulation
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks
- **Quality:** Race-specific intensity

### Taper
- **Focus:** Maintain intensity, reduce volume
- **Duration:** 1-3 weeks
- **Volume:** Decreasing 40-60%

### Recovery / Transition
- **Focus:** Rest, cross-training, easy running
- **Duration:** 1-4 weeks
- **Volume:** Minimal

---

## Key Metrics

### Use With Confidence
- **Heart Rate** - reliable intensity marker
- **Pace** - objective performance measure
- **Volume** - trackable load component
- **Consistency** - leading indicator of success
- **RPE** (experienced runners) - valuable subjective input

### Use With Caution
- **HRV** - correlate only, no reproducible science for prescription
- **Stress scores** - athlete self-reports are unreliable; derive from data
- **RPE** (new runners) - self-assessment improves with experience

### Derive, Don't Ask
- **Stress level** - infer from RHR trends, sleep, performance variance
- **Fatigue** - infer from performance vs. effort mismatches
- **Readiness** - infer from multiple signals, not single metrics

---

## Pacing Principles

### Race Distance Matters
- **Marathon:** Even or slight negative splits optimal
- **Half Marathon:** Even splits typically optimal
- **10K:** Even or slight negative
- **5K:** Positive splits can work; world records have been set this way

**Application:** Don't assume negative splits = optimal for all distances.

### Pacing is a Skill
Internal calibration improves with experience. Race simulations and tune-up races develop this skill.

---

## Workout Limits

### Quality Volume Limits (Weekly)
| Intensity | Max % Weekly Volume |
|-----------|---------------------|
| VO2max (I) | 8% or ~10K |
| Repetition (R) | 5% or ~5 miles |

### Quality Session Spacing
- 2-3 days between hard sessions
- Full recovery before next quality

---

## What We Track

### Per Run
- Pace, distance, duration
- Heart rate (avg, max)
- Elevation
- Workout classification (auto + override)
- RPE (if provided)

### Daily
- Sleep (duration + quality)
- Resting HR
- HRV (as correlate)
- Subjective feelings (optional)

### Weekly
- Total volume
- Intensity distribution
- Consistency score
- Long run completion

### By Phase
- Volume progression
- Fitness trajectory
- Race performances

### Career
- PRs by distance
- Injury history
- What works / what doesn't for this athlete

---

## Core Beliefs

1. **Recovery is when adaptation happens.** Training is stress. Rest is growth.

2. **The body is smarter than the plan.** Listen to signals.

3. **Long-term trumps short-term.** Never sacrifice months for a week.

4. **Data informs, athlete decides.** We present; they choose.

5. **Enjoyment predicts consistency.** If they hate it, they'll quit.

6. **Mind limits before body does.** Mental state matters.

7. **Every athlete is an experiment of one.** Population studies inform; individual data decides.
