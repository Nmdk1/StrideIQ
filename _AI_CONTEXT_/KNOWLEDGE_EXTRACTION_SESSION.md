# Knowledge Extraction Session (v2)

**Purpose:** The knowledge base already contains 239 entries from Daniels, Pfitzinger, Hansons, Roche, John Davis, and others. What it needs from you is your **decision-making layer**—how you synthesize and apply that knowledge to individual athletes.

## Already Captured From Your v1 Answers

### Core Principles (Locked In)

1. **Consistency is the single most important factor** - "consistently and frequently running"

2. **Most runners lack periodization and structured quality sessions** - This is what they get wrong

3. **Easy days serve specific purposes:**
   - Flushing legs after hard runs
   - Stimulating mitochondrial production  
   - Should NOT compromise upcoming workouts
   
4. **No such thing as junk miles EXCEPT:**
   - If form breaks down
   - If there's a niggle
   - "Going another mile or two poses more risk than benefit"

5. **What separates improvers from plateauers:**
   - Periodized training
   - Attention to details (nutrition, recovery, life stress)
   - Consistency (the king)

6. **Data vs. Feel:** "No right or wrong answer—varies by runner"

## What the Knowledge Base Already Knows

From the extracted books/sources, the system already has:

**From Daniels:**
- VDOT formula and pace tables (E, M, T, I, R paces)
- Training principles and laws
- Periodization model

**From Pfitzinger:**
- Marathon training principles
- Long run and medium-long run guidelines
- Recovery and periodization for marathoners

**From Hansons:**
- Cumulative fatigue approach
- Half-marathon methodology

**From Roche (SWAP):**
- Happy running philosophy
- Training principles and adaptation concepts

**From John Davis:**
- Evidence-based training principles
- Basic training foundations

## What's Missing: Your Synthesis Layer

The books give principles. You give the **judgment calls**. These questions target that.

### On When To Apply What

**Q6: When you look at an athlete, what signals tell you "this person needs more Daniels-style structured intensity" vs. "this person needs more Roche-style easy volume"?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q7: The knowledge base has multiple periodization models (Daniels, Pfitzinger, Hansons). What factors determine which approach fits which athlete?**

*Your answer:*

---

### On Individual Calibration

**Q8: When you start working with a new athlete, what do you look for in their first 2-4 weeks that tells you how they respond to training?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q9: What athlete characteristics make you deviate from what the books recommend?**
(e.g., "Daniels says X, but when I see Y in an athlete, I do Z instead")

*Your answer:*

---

### On Decision Triggers

**Q10: What specific signals make you say "back off NOW" vs. "push through, this is normal adaptation stress"?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q11: You said form breakdown and niggles are when to stop. What early warning signs appear BEFORE those?**

*Your answer:*

---

### On Long Runs (You Said It Depends)

**Q12: You said the long run can accomplish many things with many tools. Walk me through the decision tree:**
- What determines if a long run should be easy?
- What determines if it should have race-pace segments?
- What determines its length relative to weekly volume?

*Your answer:*

---

### On Quality Sessions (You Said The Question Was Unintelligent)

**Q13: Fair point. Let me try again: When you've decided an athlete needs a quality session, what sequence of questions do you ask yourself to land on the specific session?**

*Your answer:*

---

### On Your Contrarian Views

**Q14: Where do you disagree with Daniels?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q15: Where do you disagree with Pfitzinger?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q16: What popular training advice (from books, internet, wherever) makes you roll your eyes?**

*Your answer:*

---

### On Race-Specific

**Q17: Boston vs. Berlin—does the course actually change much in your training approach, or is that overhyped?**

*Your answer:*

---

**Q18: What's the most common way people mess up their taper?**

*Your answer:*

---

### The Meta Question

**Q19: If the AI had to learn ONE heuristic from you for making training decisions, what would it be?**

*Your answer:*

---

## How This Gets Used

Your answers will create a **synthesis layer** on top of the knowledge base:

1. **Athlete Assessment Rules** - What signals map to which methodology blend
2. **Override Rules** - When to deviate from book recommendations
3. **Decision Trees** - Your sequences of questions that lead to prescriptions
4. **Warning Signals** - Your personal red flags
5. **Contrarian Positions** - Where your experience says the books are wrong

This is what makes the AI's recommendations **yours**, not just regurgitated book content.

## If Questions Still Feel Off

Tell me. I'm trying to extract how you THINK, not what you PRESCRIBE. The books handle prescriptions. You handle judgment.
