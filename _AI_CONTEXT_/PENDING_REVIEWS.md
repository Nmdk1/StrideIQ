**Date Created:** January 10, 2026  

**Plan Location:**  
- Archetype: `plans/archetypes/marathon_mid_6d_18w.json`
- Preview: `plans/generated/marathon_mid_6d_18w.html`

**Key Features:**
- 40-55 mpw, 6 days/week, 18 weeks
- Sunday as day 7 (week builds toward long run/race)
- Strides 3x/week in base (Tue/Thu/Fri weeks 1-3)
- T-block progression: 6×5min → 5×6min → 4×8min → ... → 30min continuous
- MP progression in long runs: 8mi (broken) → 12mi (broken) → 16mi CONTINUOUS
- Dress rehearsal: 22mi with 16 continuous @ MP, race nutrition, race gear
- Cut-backs every 4th week
- No intervals mid-build (injury prevention)
- MP touches in medium-long runs (weeks 9, 11, 14)

**Target Athlete:**
- Currently 35-45 mpw consistently
- Has completed at least one marathon or sub-2:00 half
- Wants to RACE, not just finish
- Can commit to 6 days/week
- Ready for structured training

**Questions for Reviewer:**
1. Does the weekly structure make sense (Mon rest, Thu quality, Sun long)?
2. Are the MP progressions realistic?
3. Is the dress rehearsal (16 continuous @ MP) appropriate?
4. Should cut-backs be every 3rd week for a 79yo?
5. What's missing from his experience?

**After Review:**
- Apply feedback
- Consider age-specific adjustments
- Finalize for production
- Build remaining plan variants
