## The Transformation (Investor Story)

**Couch to 1:27 half marathon in 2 years. Age 57.**

While:
- Working 50 hours/week to survive
- Reversing insulin resistance
- Reversing obesity
- Reversing GERD
- Both PRs run while injured (bone injury Nov 25, 2025)

This is not just a running app. This is a complete health transformation platform, built by someone who lived it.

## 2025 Season Structure

### Base Phase (May - September)
- **Focus**: Aerobic foundation in Mississippi summer heat
- **Volume**: Building to 50+ km/week
- **Key Sessions**: Saturday intervals on track (hidden as "runs" in data)
- **Progression**: Gradual volume increase, heat adaptation

### Build Phase (October - November)
- **Focus**: Race-specific preparation
- **Peak Volume**: 65+ km/week
- **Key Workouts Identified**:
  - Oct 12: 18 miles at marathon pace + 4x1600m @ 3:40/km
  - Oct 19: 19 miles with tempo finish
  - Oct 26: 20 miles at marathon pace (3:45-3:50/km)
  - Nov 2: 22 miles with 10 @ MP
  - Nov 9: 22 miles (long run peak)
  - Nov 22: 16 miles (taper)

### Injury & Recovery (Nov 25 - Present)
- **Injury**: Bone injury during 5x600m after 22-mile run (Nov 25)
- **Response**: All runs since Dec 13 are slow, easy, diagnostic
- **Goal**: Return to running (hoping Jan 8, 2026)

## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles (In Michael's Words)
1. **Suit plans to athletes, not athletes to plans**
2. **Easy needs to be easy** - don't let easy runs fatigue quality sessions
3. **No big changes from 1-2 bad workouts** - identify trends and root causes
4. **HRV is a correlate, not a prescription** - track it, but don't base decisions on it without reproducible data for that athlete
5. **Stress must be derived from outcomes** - athletes can't quantify stress; build metrics that correlate to performance
6. **RPE is great for experienced runners**, less reliable for new ones
7. **Positive splits can win** - 5K world records have come from positive splits

### What Works for Michael
- High-volume long runs with quality embedded (MP segments, tempo finishes)
- Back-to-back long run weekends in base phase
- Saturday track work during base building
- Consistent 6-day weeks

### Red Flags
- Quality work after exhausting long runs (injury trigger)
- Ignoring early warning signs

## Data Insights

### Strava Activity Names Are Critical
The activity NAME contains workout intent that GPS/HR cannot reveal:
- "18 miles at marathon pace" vs seeing 4:10/km pace
- "Recovery run" vs seeing slow pace
- "Intervals" vs seeing variable pace

### Phase Context Changes Interpretation
- Same efficiency score means different things in base vs peak vs recovery
- December "decline" was actually intentional recovery from peak + injury

---

## Coaching Influences

Michael has studied and used:
- Jack Daniels
- Pete Pfitzinger
- Greg McMillan
- John Davis (resonates most)
- Hansons

**Key insight**: "None of them are totally correct. They are the foundation, but training philosophy has evolved beyond them."

---

## System Requirements for Michael

1. **Parse workout names** from Strava for intent
2. **Track injuries** and recovery periods
3. **Detect training phases** automatically
4. **Flag races** vs training runs
5. **Multi-scale context** - week, block, season, career
6. **Don't alarm on intentional recovery**

## Next Steps

- [ ] Return to running (target: Jan 8, 2026)
- [ ] Deploy beta
- [ ] Build injury tracking
- [ ] Implement phase detection
- [ ] Parse Strava activity names
