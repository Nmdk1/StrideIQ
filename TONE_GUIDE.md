## Core Principles

### 1. Sparse & Direct
- **Say what matters. Nothing more.**
- No fluff, no marketing speak, no filler words
- Get to the point immediately
- Trust the data to speak for itself

**Good:** "Sleep explains 45% of your efficiency gains."  
**Bad:** "Great news! We've discovered that your sleep patterns are significantly correlated with your running efficiency improvements!"

### 2. Irreverent When Earned
- **Not adversarial. Not "me too." Somewhere in between.**
- Dry, sardonic, athlete-to-athlete
- Call out vanity metrics without being cruel
- Redirect to what actually matters: performance outcomes

**Good:** "BMI says 28. Cool story. What's your age-graded 10K time?"  
**Bad:** "Your BMI is high, which might affect your performance."  
**Also Bad:** "Your BMI is perfect! You're doing great!"

### 3. Honest & Data-Driven
- **The numbers speak. We don't.**
- No coddling, no sugar-coating
- Present facts. Let athletes draw conclusions.
- If data is insufficient, say so directly

**Good:** "Not enough data yet. Log 10 more runs to see patterns."  
**Bad:** "Keep tracking and you'll see insights soon!"

### 4. Never Prescriptive
- **We show patterns. Athletes decide actions.**
- Never tell athletes what to do
- Never suggest they're missing insights
- Never imply they're falling behind

**Good:** "Log today's pre-run fuel? (Optional — helps spot patterns when you do.)"  
**Bad:** "Don't forget to log your nutrition to unlock insights!"

### 5. Never Guilt-Inducing
- **Everything is optional. Nothing is required.**
- Never suggest missing data is a problem
- Never imply athletes should do more
- Never create FOMO or pressure

**Good:** "Nutrition logging is optional. Log when it's convenient."  
**Bad:** "Complete your nutrition profile to see personalized insights!"

### 6. Supportive But Not Coddling
- **We're here to improve. That takes hard work.**
- Acknowledge effort without praise
- Support improvement without cheerleading
- "Nobody cares. Work harder." — Cameron Hanes

**Good:** "Your efficiency improved 3% over the last month. Keep going."  
**Bad:** "Amazing work! You're crushing it! Keep up the great effort!"

## Voice Examples by Context

### Discovery Dashboard

**"What's Working" Card:**
- ✅ "Sleep explains 45% of your efficiency gains. Cool."

- ✅ "Work stress → efficiency drop. Pattern detected."
- ❌ "Your work stress is hurting your performance. Try to reduce it."

### Empty States

**No Correlations Yet:**
- ✅ "Not enough data. Log 10 more runs to see patterns."
- ✅ "Need more data. Keep running."
- ❌ "Start tracking more activities to unlock insights!"

**No Activities:**
- ✅ "No activities yet. Connect Strava or log manually."
- ❌ "Get started by logging your first run!"

### Nutrition Prompts

**Pre-Run Fuel Prompt:**
- ✅ "Log today's pre-run fuel? (Optional — helps spot patterns when you do.)"

- ❌ "Aerobic decoupling is a measure of your cardiovascular efficiency..."

**Efficiency Factor:**
- ✅ "EF = Normalized Grade Pace / Heart Rate. Lower is better."
- ❌ "Efficiency Factor measures how efficiently you run..."
