Fix Race Detection - Reset all race flags and recalculate with improved logic.

This script:
1. Resets all is_race_candidate flags to False
2. Recalculates race detection for all activities using improved conservative logic
3. Only marks activities as races if they:
   - Match standard race distances (5K, 10K, Half, Full Marathon)
   - Have high HR intensity (>88% of max)
   - Have consistent pace
   - Meet confidence threshold of 0.80
