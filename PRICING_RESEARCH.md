## Our Pricing Strategy

### Positioning
- **Value-focused**: Free/low-cost entry, premium for ongoing value
- **Race-specific focus**: Unique offering for race participants
- **Transparent**: Clear, simple pricing structure

### Market Reality Check
- **Static plans**: Often free or $5-$15 (low value, commoditized)
- **Ongoing coaching**: $15-$50/month (premium, high value)
- **Our advantage**: AI-powered adaptation (should command premium)

### Revised Pricing Strategy

**1. Fixed Plans (One-Time)**
- **Price: $9/plan** (or FREE with email signup)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Static plans are commoditized (many free templates exist)
  - Low barrier to entry
  - Loss leader to convert to subscription
  - Still generates revenue from one-time buyers
  - Alternative: Free with email signup (lead generation)

**2. Race-Specific Plans**
- **Price: $12/plan**
- **Rationale**:
  - Slight premium over fixed ($3 more)
  - Includes intake questionnaire (adds value)
  - Race date-specific customization
  - Can be sold through race partnerships
  - Still accessible but generates revenue

**3. Guided Self-Coaching** ⭐ PREMIUM TIER
- **Price: $24/month**
- **Rationale**:
  - This is our DIFFERENTIATED product (AI adaptation)
  - Should command premium vs. static plans
  - Matches/beats human coaching value ($50-$100/month)
  - Adaptive updates = ongoing value
  - Efficiency trends = unique diagnostic value
  - Performance diagnostics = premium feature
  - Strava integration = convenience
  - **This is where we make money** - not on static plans
