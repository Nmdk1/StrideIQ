# Value-First Messaging Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**We provide value TO consumers. Runna extracts value FROM consumers.**

This fundamental difference needs to be visible, tangible, and felt by every visitor.

**Complete Health & Fitness Management:**  
We take a whole-person approach—monitoring nutrition, sleep, work patterns, and activities to understand how every input affects your performance. This is the solution we wish we had and couldn't find. We correlate every input with every output, identifying trends and direct correlations between what you do and how you perform.

## Current State Analysis

### What We're Doing Right
✅ All four calculators free, no signup  
✅ Instant access - no barriers  
✅ Research-backed formulas  
✅ Transparent pricing  
✅ No credit card required for free tools  

### What Needs Improvement
❌ Value-first philosophy not explicitly stated  
❌ Not contrasting our approach vs competitors  
❌ "Free" messaging could be stronger  
❌ No clear "try before you buy" narrative  
❌ Value proposition could be more emotional
