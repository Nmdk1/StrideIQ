# Brand Voice: Irreverent, Honest, Performance-Focused

## Core Philosophy

**Bad PR from fat coddling is GOOD PR.**

If our focus on health improvement through performance and biomarkers offends the coddling crowd, that's a feature, not a bug.

Our nation is 80%+ obese. They need to be offended. They need to face facts.

## Tone Guidelines

### Middle Ground: Irreverent, Not Adversarial
- Dry, sardonic, irreverent
- Respects intelligence
- No coddling, no excuses
- Performance-focused, not validation-focused
- **Not "me too" energy** - repulsive
- **Not adversarial** - let numbers speak
- **Middle ground:** Irreverent, data-driven, no debate

### When to Use Irreverence

**✅ Appropriate:**
- Support responses to vanity complaints
- UI tooltips and warnings
- Empty states and "not enough data" messages
- Blog posts and social content
- FAQ responses

**⚠️ Use Carefully:**
- Public press statements (more measured but still direct)
- Legal/regulatory communications (factual, not irreverent)
- Genuine health concerns (respectful but firm)

## Support Response Templates

### BMI/Body Fat Complaints

**Philosophy:** Those complaining about muscle vs fat are looking for validation in the wrong places. Not here to debate. Let the numbers speak.

**Template 1:**
```
BMI says [X], body fat says [Y]. Cool story. What's your age-graded performance?

[Show their age-graded % vs world-class standard]
Why aren't you at [elite age-graded %]?

The numbers speak. We're not here to debate.
```

**Template 2:**
```
Nice scan. How'd your last half go?

[Show their age-graded % vs world-class standard]
BMI hates muscle. The marathon hates extra weight. Who wins?

Let the data speak.
```

**Template 3:**
```
I believe the data. Show me the splits.

[Compare age-graded performance to world-class standards]
We're focused on performance outcomes, not proxy metrics.
```

**Key:** Always compare their actual race times to elite age group standards. Let the numbers do the talking. No debate.

### General Vanity Complaints

**Template:**
```
[Show their age-graded performance % vs world-class standards]

Why aren't you at [elite age-graded %]?

We're focused on performance outcomes, not aesthetics.
The numbers speak. We're not here to debate.
```

**Key:** Always redirect to age-graded performance. Compare to world-class age-graded standards. Let the numbers do the talking.

## UI Messaging Examples

### BMI Toggle Tooltip
```
"BMI visible now. Fair warning: we don't care about this number 
unless it moves your race times. Still want to see it?"
```

### No Correlation Yet
```
BMI: [X]
Race results: [pending]
Correlation: TBD

Translation: Irrelevant until proven otherwise by your PRs.
```

### Empty State
```
BMI: [X]
Performance data: [collecting]
Insights: [coming when data speaks]

We don't care about BMI unless it moves your race times.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Performance-Focused:** Everything ties back to race times, efficiency, biomarkers
2. **No Coddling:** No excuses, no validation, no "but muscle mass..."
3. **Data-Driven:** Show what the data says, not what feels good
4. **Let Numbers Speak:** Compare to elite age group standards. No debate.
5. **Health Improvement:** 100% focused on health through performance/biomarkers
6. **Middle Ground:** Irreverent, not adversarial. Not "me too" energy. Let data speak.
7. **No Debate:** Those complaining are looking for validation. Show them the numbers.

## What We Don't Do

- ❌ Coddle vanity metrics
- ❌ Make excuses for high BMI
- ❌ Validate aesthetics over performance
- ❌ Enable "but I'm muscular" narratives
- ❌ Provide therapy or emotional support
- ❌ Comment outside performance/biomarker metrics

## What We Do

- ✅ Show performance correlations
- ✅ Display race results and PRs
- ✅ Track biomarkers (HRV, resting HR, recovery)
- ✅ Reveal what the data says
- ✅ Focus on health improvement through performance
- ✅ Treat athletes like intelligent adults

## The Filter

The irreverent tone filters for serious athletes:
- **Gets it:** Appreciates data-driven approach, wants truth
- **Doesn't get it:** Looking for validation in wrong places, not our target

**For complainers:** Compare their race times to elite age group standards. Let the numbers speak. We're not here to debate muscle vs fat - we're here to show performance outcomes.

## PR Strategy

**Bad PR from fat coddling = GOOD PR**

If we offend the coddling crowd:
- ✅ Filters out wrong users
- ✅ Attracts serious athletes
- ✅ Reinforces brand identity
- ✅ Generates discussion
- ✅ Viral potential

As long as we're 100% focused on health improvement through performance and biomarkers, and provide zero commentary outside driving those metrics, we're solid.

## Examples in Action

### Support Email Response
**Complaint:** "My BMI says I'm overweight but my DEXA body fat is 12%!"

**Response:**
```
Cool story. What's your 10K time?

BMI hates muscle. The marathon hates extra weight. Who wins?

We care about performance outcomes, not proxy metrics. 
Show us the splits.
```

### UI Tooltip
**When user enables BMI toggle:**
```
BMI visible now. Fair warning: we don't care about this number 
unless it moves your race times. Still want to see it?

[Yes, show it] [Cancel]
```

### Dashboard Empty State
**When BMI visible but no correlation yet:**
```
BMI: 24.3
Race results: [pending]
Correlation: TBD

Translation: Irrelevant until proven otherwise by your PRs.

[Track a race] [View performance metrics]
```

## Handling Complaints

**Philosophy:** Those complaining about muscle vs fat are looking for validation in the wrong places. We're not here to debate. Let the numbers speak.

**Approach:**
1. Show their age-graded performance % vs world-class standards
2. Ask: "Why aren't you at [elite age-graded %]?"
3. Show the data
4. No debate - numbers speak

**Example:**
- Complaint: "BMI is [X] but body fat is 12%!"
- Response: "Cool story. What's your age-graded performance? [Show their % vs world-class standard]. Why aren't you at [elite age-graded %]? The numbers speak. BMI is just a number. Meaning comes from your performance data."

**Key:** Always redirect to age-graded performance. Compare to world-class age-graded standards. Let the data do the talking.

**Bottom Line:** We're for athletes who want truth, not validation. Irreverent but not adversarial. Let the numbers speak. No debate.
